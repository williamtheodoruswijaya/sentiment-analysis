Covid was a hard transition especially having moved to a new city a few months before everything started locking down, but now I am here and settled and I have a loving partner, a great connection to their family, a really fun job and I finished my degree. But when I stop and look around I feel like nothing will ever be good enough for me and I will never be good enough, I will always have skin problems and bad teeth and acne. I will never be the artist I used to be (I have a Bachelor in fine art) because I do not have the same drive or passionate that I used to have for it. I will never have the career I built my entire plan around because I am losing my interest in art. I will never have the relationship with my family that I want because I could not stand to stay in my hometown. All I can feel is this tornado of my failures swirling around me all the damn time.

I think its probably caused by multiple things. If I had to guess, I think I just do not feel like I deserve to be happy. I have hated myself for so long that maybe I have found comfort in my misery, like its my punishment or something. And in a related way, I think I am scared of my happiness being selfish. Having been miserable for so long, I think Id feel like a selfish asshole if I suddenly got over my issues and starting liking life when I know there is countless people in the world still feeling how I did. And furthermore, its only in the last while have I really begun to take my problems seriously and have been trying to be more sympathetic to myself, but even now with all the shit I am going through its like I can still barely take care of myself. And its like I am afraid of losing the various anxiety issues and what not that make me miserable, because if I lose only them and not my self-hating mindset, Ill have even less reason to sympathise with myself. Ill be some privileged selfish asshole and be even harder on myself than I have ever been.Lastly, I think I am just afraid of the thought of living in general. Death just seems soo simple and peaceful, and I think I have become fixated on the idea of dying. Having been miserable for so many years I think the idea of any more life terrifies me. because even if I did make an amazing recovery, Ill still get new problems, which could be just as bad or worse, and I could also relapse and redevelop all my anxiety and insecurity issues. In fact I have before, in 2018 I made huge strides and then in 2019 it all turned to shit again. And a lot of it was because I had one panic attack in front of an entire class in school, in front of most of the new friends Id made in 2018 who did not know I was an insecure, anxiety ridden loser with no friends before I met them. It pretty much shattered any progress I had made, and thereafter I had multiple panic attacks in school, making it even worse.Those are my interpretations anyway. Whenever I feel like I am making any progress on myself it sends waves of panic through me. I hate it so much, and I wish to fuck I knew what was causing it, because these are all good guesses but I still do not know if that is all there is to it. I am genuinely terrified of being happy and I do not even really know why',\n",

After times of intense stress, where we do not give ourselves any leeway or breaks, our body naturally will downregulate hormones to essentially force us to stop what were doing. So we may have super high levels of glutamate and norepinepherine keeping us in a stress response, but low levels of dopamine keeping us in a depression, and the high amount of anxiety neurotransmitters because us to feel both depressed and depersonalized (freeze response) If you feel disconnected from reality this may be why',\n",

I really insisted on it, because I was drunk and could not even think straight, although she said clearly that she did care.Turns out she was hurt and does not want to talk to me anymore.She was the only person who really mattered and it made me want to keep living, I did not want to bring her pain.I tried to apologize, tried to ask him to understand and forgive me, but to no avail.The worst thing is that I did not even want to attack her the way I did, it is very easy for me to think that someone does not like me, after all I myself think I am rubbish and in no way worthy of any love.I did not even sleep the night that happened. I spent the whole night thinking about how I could kill myself.what is the fucking point on living if my life is a piece of thrash, and I feel bad absolutely all the time?

I literally she would tears.I have also agreed with her mom to fly over there and spend a week or so with them soon.My life has been just a black hole for many weeks now and it is so incredibly refreshing to poke your head above the water and see at least a glimmer of hope and sunshine. She does not deserve to lose her dad and I now have new motivation to push on and try to get better.If a terminal case like me can do it, so can you, hopefully. My daughter just pulled me out of a black pit of despair',\n",

I have been in the depths before, as I know you all have, too, but even in those deepest depressive periods, I still wonder how I know for certain that what I am experiencing is depression. It being of the subjective mind, it seems like depression does not have strict dimensions or even definitions. it is hard to pin down and say for sure, one way or another, \"I am depressed.\" This has been an obstacle for me. Trying to take it seriously. I doubt that what I have is depression. I doubt my own ability to objectively judge this. I doubt my problems are problems at all and this just makes me feel selfish and kind of like a loser that has to fake a mood disorder to get along in the world. The ambiguous nature of depression, other mood disorders, and the feeling mind alone is enough reasonable doubt to because even more suffering in me, like depression that is accompanied by a feeling of guilt and self-deprecation.Is this normal? Part of depression\\'s deception? Or are there ways to draw a line near-ish the middle between depressed and not depressed? We can do it to a very fine degree with physiological illnesses. Surely we could do the same for the mind, but are we there yet? How do you know for certain that depression is \"depression\"? I invite you to share your information and opinions.',\n",

       " '19 years old, male, from the Philippines. The lockdown here has been going on for 2 years and more now. It completely sucks here. Not only the government, but also the parenting style and community. My parents are giant narcissist, gaslighting bastards, apathetic, scapegoating, victim blaming, and abusive people. I grew up as a kid being parentified by my mom, while experiencing how my dad openly cheated on my mom while wasting the money we have. I did not feel like I grew with a father because he never tried to form an emotional connection with me. When he does, it will be him giving something while saying he worked his ass of for it so we should be grateful for it. He has forever glorified himself having a job, and he will use it in any arguments we had; \"I am the one who has the job, who feeds you, and who gives you everything. Be fucking grateful!\" in his words. I would be beaten up by him with a belt as a kid so it has left me traumatized by flinching at anything that is loud, surprising, or both. He has not changed from my childhood until now, except it has only gotten worse as time goes on. He has endlessly made me hate him with no possible resolutions. Calling me a failure, useless, good-for-nothing, and disgrace of a son does not help at all. He is the reason why I despise cheating, abusive, and manipulative people with a passion. His god complex shows to everyone else. It does not help that he is a cop so his temper is extremely bad. He has a fragile ego that will automatically collapse when told he is wrong or disagreed with. He also thinks he is doing our pets a favour by caging and leashing them their entire lives. he is truly an abusive piece of shit that does not deserve a family of his own. he is a manchild that accidentally had children.As for my mother, she is the epitome of gaslighting, victim blaming, and narcissism. You literally cannot talk to her without her taking it personally. Like my horrible father, she also thinks the world revolves around her. This is the person who made me go through parentification as a fucking 6 year old. Until now, I have been her downpour of traumas, pain, bad memories, and rants. I am literally exhausted from everything because of this. And I HAVE to listen to her or else everything turns bad; she manipulates my father to teach me a lesson. She also believes she cannot be wrong. She strongly believes feng shui, the supernatural, superstition, and the occult. She has made our entire lives revolve around superstition. I have been gaslighted by her for who knows how much; I do not even know if my feelings are valid anymore. She would try to have an emotional connection with me, but she would just make it about herself after. Literally goes and minimizes my experiences just because she thinks she had it worse. If I have not said it before, these two are very religious. They would rather pray and complain instead of doing something. They are fanatics of the horrible president we have, and they think everyone should respect them.As their child, I am riddled with face and body acne with no help at all to relieve it; father had extreme face acne, mom has extreme body acne but no help from them. Instead, I am called out for being careless about my body and face by both of them for years. They also told me that it will just go away anyway \"like theirs\", so no medicine is needed. Due to it, I experienced a lot of bullying in my highschool years because of my acne. I could not form proper connections with others and often dressed weirdly to hide my body. I was called the \"Pimple King\" by my classmates; I wanted to kill myself so much from it because I had NO ONE to talk to about it.Fast forward to now, I have fought and kind of got some freedom, but here I am again wanting to fucking die. I had already wanted to die from my highschool daysabout 6 yearscontinuously. I had attempts but none worked. I am doing everything in the house, yet I am called a fucking failure yet again by my piece of shit father for something I did not do; our cat accidentally unplugged the doorbell ringer, which my father uses to call us when he needs us for something, in our room. When he realized there was not any doorbell noises, he checked it out and saw it was unplugged. He called me a failure for it because \"I do not care about anything and do not have a sense for anything\". These days, I cannot find anything enjoyable, interesting, or fun anymore. I just want to die. I am trying to find something to do, but my brain just rings out \"what is the point?\" and I stop. I am just in bed right now wanting to fucking die. Someone take my life please.

Over the last few years I have learnt to be ok with feeling lonely and being by myself. I have learnt to enjoy my own company and that is great and all but I am still friendless.

       " 'tw talk about eating disorder further downHi, sorry for long post and bad formatting. I do not know who to ask this as I am on a long waiting list for a psychologist and have no one else to talk to.I have always had problems with breakfast, mostly because I have trouble waking up and am so tired that the thought of food makes me nauseous. Before work (I am currently on sick leave) I used to force down a sandwich only because I know I faint easily. Work also helped me maintain a somewhat proper meal schedule as I had designated lunch and snack breaks, and I always had an appetite right after work.Now when I have been been home several months, eating is a massive problem. Getting up earlier than 2pm is a huge but rare success but even if I do I just do not feel like eating for hours, despite feeling so hungry my stomach hurts and my head spins. I just do not crave anything and I try to drown the hunger with water and cigarettes and occasionally save myself from fainting by eating dextrose.This results in me lying around like a zombie for hours, not having the energy to do anything, until I feel too weak to make even a sandwich without having to sit down. Basically, during daytime, I HATE eating. I wish humans did not HAVE to eat and could survive off water.But then in the evening, I often find the cravings wash over me. Not only do I tend to eat unhealthy to begin with bc I do not have the energy to cook (for example I often just have microwave food or frozen pizza), but at night while watching shows or playing games I feel some kind of NEED to have something. Sometimes cigarettes and tea works, but often the cravings are too strong. It can be anything I have lying around, like crisps, chocolate, nuts, anything. Sometimes it feels like a proper craving but sometimes it feels like I just have to occupy my hands and mouth. Not giving into this often results in nail biting instead, or even worse pulling at my toenails until they bleed (gross i know, but I physically cannot stop and have not been able to show my feet to anyone throughout my life). Giving into the cravings on the other hand makes me feel disgusting, like a grotesque emotional meat machine that keeps eating just for the sake of eating. I feel disgusted by the warm feeling I got after eating those tasty donuts, like how I sometimes feel disgusted after spending money on some useless expensive shit I do not really need but that gave me happiness for one small moment. It makes me feel materialistic but like, with food, if that makes any sense.Now I know the lack of food during the day probably is a big reason for the nocturnal cravings. But it is so hard forcing myself to eat when my appetite is not there, let alone cook proper meals. I am also very conscious about my body and feel like shit knowing that I have put on some weight in recent years, even though I KNOW deep inside that no one cares about that and that weight should not define my attractiveness. But despite this, I have never had an ED. And despite having somewhat ED-like thoughts about food, this feels like mainly a problem with appetite related to my depression and apathetic tendencies. I know that if I could just pull myself together, I could have somewhat healthy eating habits.My past therapist kept nagging me about meal planning but even when I am grocery shopping I cannot for the love of god come up with any ingredients to buy, despite being kind of good at cooking. Hell, planning ANYTHING nowadays feels like climbing a mountain.Does anyone have similar problems, like lack of appetite? How do you refrain from giving into cravings/comfort eating? How do you manage your daily food intake when depression takes away most energy and enthusiasm to do anything at all? How do you deal with apathy, the kind that makes it hard to even walk from the couch to the bed? How do you keep afloat? Because I am on the verge of drowning. No appetite during day, cravings at night',\n",

I can see how my partners go from being attracted to me to feeling sorry and completely turned off. I do not blame them. I do not want them to carry any of my burdens. I want to own up to them and keep fighting to get better. But with each passing relationship, I just become more afraid of opening up about my mental struggles and having them realize that the confident, fun version of me is kind of a part-time deal.On top of it all, I seem to be developing some kind of body dysmorphia. Depression sure seems to have done a number on me physically and its causing me to age a lot more quickly than my peers. I am rapidly losing my hair, about a third of my beard and body hair is already gray, I have bad eye bags and dark circles and, although I have tried, I just do not look good completely bald and I have been told as much by friends. I legitimately hate looking in the mirror most days. I even started dating older women in hopes that it would even things out, but the same thing happened.My last partner recently left me after I became insecure and started acting weird and it really hurt me because I actually did care about her. But somehow, just a week later, the universe has already put two new women in my life who are showing interest. The thing is, I am seriously afraid of trying this again and screwing it up once more. I do not think my heart can take much more disappointment and I am tired of superficial connections.I know I need to develop self-love and find something to get excited about every time I wake up before I try to find someone again, but the thing is I am also very lost and lack direction in life. The only thing I am truly passionate about is music, and that is just not going to pay the bills or provide me with the financial stability that a relationship requires. Besides that, I am working on finishing a degree in biochemistry (two semesters left), but I have no desire to go to grad school or Med school, and the job prospects with a B.S. in that field look bleak.Are there any guys out there who have managed to be in successful or satisfying relationships in spite of all your struggles? If so, how did you manage? I do not think my depression will ever go away at this point, and I do not want to end up alone or hurting myself and others even further. Thank you for reading.

       " 'First time posting here and feeling a bit ambivalent about doing so as I have never really been active in this community or helped anyone, so feel a bit self indulgent and selfish posting. 30, soon to be 31. I have had an issue with weed since I was 19 (did not accept I had an addiction until 24 but never made any efforts to address it due to my own self loathing and warped mindframe that I \"deserved\" to be nothing more than an addict and waste of space). Cut down hugely but now that my mind is clearer, I cannot stop thinking about how incredibly shit a person I am. Used to have friends in Uni, drifted from a lot of them due to smoking (I would flake on invites to things and smoke myself into a daze. Rinse and repeat). Got together with someone from a local sporting community I was involved in and had tons of friends in it. I let myself believe that these people actually liked me and that my self-loathing was unwarranted. When we broke up, and I very shortly thereafter suffered a catastrophic leg injury (I can walk again now, thankfully), it became very clear a lot of those people much rathered my ex than myself and I lost what I thought were very close friends. No one bar my family visited me in hospital and none of those friends ever reached out to see how I was. It destroyed me for a while but I talked myself into believing I was better off without people like that. It still stung and I basically have never properly returned to social media or to that community due to feeling so shit and hated (it was very clear that some of them really really did not like me, and a lot of rumours were spread by a dick I had rejected from that community after he had propositioned me. I was not around to defend myself due to the injury and I guess people decided they would rather believe his lies than ask me. A further indication of how low they view me.)That was a good few years ago and I still cannot shake the sense of \"betrayal\" and that I am clearly a POS if all of these people decided they wanted nothing to do with me. Out of sight, out of mind.I feel like anyone who is not family that is still in contact with me is doing it as a favour to me, and cannot shake the feeling everyone actually really dislikes me. I hate myself and find social interaction difficult with people because in the back of my mind I am always telling myself that the person hates me or finds me boring/self indulgent/an asshole etc. This has further made me withdraw as I do not want to inconvenience others. I have a good job I feel I do not deserve, which I am struggling with doing at the moment due to how low I am. I do not see the point in anything and find myself thinking that if I killed myself at least work could hire someone competent. I have a loving boyfriend who is incredible and so patient but due to historic sexual abuse, I can be quite nervous with intimacy. I have only ever once really been able to be in the \"here and now\" in the moment with him without my mind dissociating or me recalling the abuse. I have found myself thinking if I killed myself, he could be free to do what he wants and eventually meet someone who is good for him. I have been talking myself out of breaking up with him as I know if I do do that, that is one less obstacle on the path to killing myself. I cannot shake the feeling that I am the worst thing for him and that I am wasting his life when he could be so much happier with someone who deserves him. I have a supportive family. My mum and her partner are great, getting on in life and I find myself getting worried about the 2 of them as they get older and then chastise myself for being kind of \"ageist\". I have a sister, we are not close but we try to be but there is a lot of tension and tbh I do not like her as a person and believe a lot of my self hatred is rooted in some very serious bullying and abuse by her when I was a small kid. I have a brother but he is estranged from the family. We very occasionally check in but it is clear he wishes he was not related to us at times (he has his own mental health issues and I think blames our family for a lot of it.). I have aunts and uncles who are lovely and kind and I love them all very much. But. I feel like if I killed myself it would make everyone is lives so much easier.I can be hard to get on with, and am high strung and have a hearing sensitivity that makes being around loud or shrill noises very difficult. That sadly includes the noises of kids simply having fun and being a bit boisterous. I hate that I get physiological pain just by being around my niece and nephew when they are giddy. I am abnormal and I feel like I bring everyone else down or that they are only nice to me because they feel sorry for me. I cannot stop thinking I am a burden, a waste of space, a nuisance. When I see people I know who are very sick, or people with very serious conditions that impair their quality of life, I feel like an ungrateful POS that I have a working healthy body and yet want to die. I do not deserve my body and keep finding myself wishing there was a way I could trade. I wish that I could give my able body or my natural life expectancy to others. That if I killed myself, the x amount of years I did not live could transfer over to someone else.If I killed myself, my mum and her partner would not have to catch up with me or endure my presence. If I killed myself, my sister would not have to poorly pretend to tolerate me nor pay back a loan I gave her years ago which she keeps dodging. If I killed myself, some of my savings could go to my brother which would hugely help him out. If I killed myself, my extended family would not have to waste any time talking to me at family gatherings and they could actually have some fun. If I killed myself, the majority of my savings would go to my mum and her partner and would help them do some renovations on my mum\\'s house or help her to buy the house of her dreams. If I killed myself, my partner could be free, would not have to mind me, and would also get a whack of my savings which would help him travel the world like he is always dreamed of. If I killed myself, people would not have to be polite to me. If I killed myself, I cease to be a burden (after the funeral has been planned and done). If I killed myself, depending in the means, I could donate my organs and actually do something good with my life for once.I know my mind is clearly twisted right now but I cannot stop thinking that if I honestly just killed myself, everyone else would be so much better off. I am miserable, I constantly try to suppress it or hide it, I feel like people really dislike me or tolerate me and almost all of my friends have drifted away from me. I have no common ground with anyone and my drug addiction wasted so many years where I ultimately have no real hobbies, or interests or personality. I just want to die but know it will hurt my family. Good live from the outside but I just want to press \"off\"',\n",

       " 'Last year the lack of future hope, and general pointlessness of life finally got to me, the cycle of disaster, recovering from lifes shit, then being thrown another curve ball finally got to me. I made a decision one night, and drunk myself silly and tried to jump off a high rise flat building, but could not get myself over the edge. The police arrested me, got me off the building and took me to a cell. I got let out later that week, I told everyone I was just drunk and it was a mistake... everything they needed to hear to let me go.I decided that day on my way home, to just enjoy one more year of life, ignore any problems as it will not matter in the long run, and hope my life spirals downwards into such a shit hole that the act of actually killing myself will not be as difficult next time around, take the options away from myself.I actually had some good times in this year, met a girl that went well for a good few months(as far as relationships go with people that is a good one for me) tried new hobbies, Got in rather good shape due to taking up boxing, traveled to a few places I wanted to see. it is not been bad, just not sustainable. Today, one year on I am in more dept than I ever have been, I am about to lose my job due to not really being in a fit state to perform at it anymore(and quite frankly, not focusing at all on it because of the plan in the back of my head) I still have 2 friends, but I do not really get on with people full stop. This is what I wanted a year ago, and although I know that, I guess I did not think I would make it this far, and now it is suddenly here. Nothings changed, I still cannot bare the thought of going through life like this any longer. It feels like just living life because that is what is expected. But I still am scared to die.I am well aware that within basically the next 30 days or so everything is going to come crumbling down around me, it is already in motion, I have done a very good job of not leaving myself any outs. And the state I am currently in, I know I will not handle it well enough to see a way to get through any of it. I guess just hoped it would be easier this time to actually pull the trigger as it were, yet it does not feel like it is going to be. I really do not want to carry on with this stuff. But I do have people who love me who will be upset. I do want to die, but I am scared of that moment still. In a way I wish I would just happen to step in the road at get hit by a bus and not have to actually do the act myself.I do not think at this point I will ever be able to do it, but I am unfortunately very good at hurting my life in other ways.I regret not killing myself one year ago. One Year ago today, I found myself locked in a hospital cell for my own protection. Today I have still had enough.',\n",

       " 'I am sorry if you are already going through something and that if what I wrote, brought you down or something but I needed to let things go somewhere and this is the best place for this. Please bear with me, it will be a little long.So, here it goes. There comes a time in life when things just go down and down. You pick yourself up, hopeful for things to get better, you try and work but the end results stays the same and more things get burdened up after that. Like, it has been too long, I break down, then get back up hoping things will finally get better every single day and when you keep doing all this for a long time, you start to get tired and lose hope, but the damn things inside your heart and mind makes you think something will get better only for you to get disappointed again.I am dealing with my problems, I want to focus on them but when you have problems of not only yours but also of your closed ones it gets really tough, you get lost and do not know what to do, how you got into this mess and how you can get out of it. I have had depression for as long as I can remember but it did not affected me much, nut the last 5-6 years have been too much. Ever since I become an adult, I realised how much problems I am around, that are not only mine but of others close to me as well. These are one of the few years of my life that I want focus only on my career but this is just so tough. The things, problems, responsibilities, situation, future, all this has become so much for me to handle I am scared about everything now, 2 days I will be okay and ambitious but something will arise and I will be back to square one. This has been the case as long as I remember, everytime I work to change my life, some uncontrollable shit happens, that breaks me. I try to stay positive, I try to not break down. Apart from this, I feel alone, I have never shared my problems, my situation, stuff I go through with anyone. Although, its not like I have not tried, I did but the thing is no one wants to listen and I do not blame them for this either, nobody wants to listen to that. They will post hundreds of stuff about to talk to them, that they will listen and what not but the thing is nobody wants to listen, no matter what they say. Sometimes, I want that one person that I can talk, that one person with whom when I talk, I forget about all these problems and just be with her, you know. Like, one thing I have always been sure about is that I will take care of that special person for the rest of my life, but have been hurt in relationship and stuff so much that I am afraid of all this now, no girl wants to be with a guy like me, I have seen my crush literally with a person who is rude to her, blames her, treats her like shit than to be with me and they have been together for a long time. I mean, I do not know what is wrong with me or what I do not know. I genuinely care for others and wants the best for others, and I do not care that other people do not want the same for me. But have been hurt so much, in friendship, relationship, what not because of which I have developed several trust issues before opening up, I am scared to open up because I did that easily in the past and fuck, they left or betrayed me as usual but still I do not want to hurt or want anything bad to happen to them. I was even bullied at school for sometime, not physically, and thought about quitting school and taking my life. Now that I am writing this every bad, every damn thing are coming back, that I did not wanted to remember. I lost friends at school, they stopped talking which I afterwards got to know that was because someone was saying different different made up things on my name. Almost every single one of my friend, that I had near my house shifted from here and I ended up losing contact with them as well. I spent a lot of time all by myself that I did not even managed to hold friends at college or forgot the way of maintaining relationships. I was told that some.girls were interested in me during college and at school but the scars and the problems never gave me the courage to move forward and build one relationship with someone special. Sometimes, I See other couples and see how supportive the girls are to their boyfriends and what not and I want that, I want that connection, that feeling of love again in my life but I am afraid that I will mess it up and also, I do not want someone else to go through what I am going through because I know how tough it is but still my stupid mind and heart wants that certain someone who will love me and I will love her. I do not even know what to do or want anyone. I am losing hope again.Btw thank you, if you read it. I am grateful, this was just a rant. I hope you are doing great and your problems fade away and only happiness comes in your life. And sorry for this long, I needed to let things out otherwise my mind was going insane.

We were looking forward to when I graduated so we could work more on the house together, get married finally, and start trying for a baby. For the first time in my life I had lasting long-term happiness, it was beautiful. The week I graduated she told me she would fallen out of love with me and there was nothing to be done. I think my absence and stress due to uni had turned me into a burnt out, argumentative, and barely present person over lockdown. She had ownership of the house so I lost that too and had to move back in with my parents. I had so much work still to do to create a showreel and get a job and was kind of looking forward to doing it but now I have lost all passion for my work. Its been 3 months and I still dream about her every night.

For me these last two years were absolute hell and it was not because of the pandemic but there are several reasons like:1. I am pretty smart and got into med university by the age of 17 and because of the amount of stress and trauma I had to deal with I failed2. After failing my parents gave me a second chance to reenter the university and I took it but I was so unhappy that I chose not to do it and went against my parents simply because I was severely depressed and hospitalized due to psychological pains like constant chest pains and I could not breathe3. My parents were not supportive of me. They were supportive when they where showing off to their peers or friends and my dad told me \" You are nothing but a disappointment and you embarrass us wherever we go\" I was highly discouraged4. I still get yelled at and pretty much am verbally insulted and was told I cannot do shit in life because I am a complete failure.

I feel so restrained and so closed in like in a box and I suffocate so I feel like I should say fuck you to my parents and leave but I do not know how well I can deal with myself there too6. Technically they killed all my dreams, what I could have became and they took my dreams and crushed it and are the MOST negative people I have ever seen in my life and I do not even want to look at them. I know it is unethical to hate your parents but do not blame the ones they do because some parents clearly suck and I even told them \" You should have never became parents\" or \"I wish I was never born I did not ask to you to be my parents\"My parents makes me want to kill myself and have suicidal thoughts and I cannot take it anymore. They do not know how to communicate at all and they have zero empathy and funnily enough my parents hate each other and themselves as well; weird how they have to reflect that on me too. I was an innocent kid with big dreams. I was not born to be insulted like this, they are the fakest people I have ever met too. Acting like they care about me in front of others all the fake hugs and such and ask me why I do not ever let them to hug me; it is because I hate you and I do not want to see you.

I do not have social media accounts, I do not text people, and now that I am working from home every day I barely interact with anyone from work other than emails and the occasional phone call. For the last 6 months I have very little job motivation and have started to eat unhealthily, putting on some weight. Feeling completely isolated from society, I have started to not care about COVID, what is happening in the world, and so forth. I still enjoy my solo hobbies though, mostly gaming and watching TV. I only leave the house a few times a week for some exercise in the park, or for a swim with my son. I do not particularly feel lonely, and have zero motivation to go out and make friends or join social activities. I never thought I could be depressed, because outside of working hours I am quite contented. I joke around with my family, I enjoy my gaming and so on.

Its like someone whispers in my ear: are you sure you need to eat that,have you seen how much weight you have been loosing,have you noticed that your bones are showing more and more? Keep this up and soon you will be perfect. And with that comes my other friend. Depression. I do not want to get up in the morning,I do not want to see people,they exhaust me,they make me angry and annoyed. I do not want to do anything. And those horrible thoughts of ending myself. I just want to die. If I could just leave this world and sleep forever. The only thing holding me above the surface are my kids. How much I love them. How I could never do that to them. I could never leave them with that pain. Only reason I posted here is because I needed to get it out one way or another. I am not looking for pity or help. Hopefully I will bounce back soon.

And in a recent post, someone confirmed that they have a new group chat.I have been under the worst depressive period ever, after doing so well in 2019, and because I was not ready to socialize and talk about mundane things with them or joke around with them, I told them I will just be with myself for a while. They were initially understanding, and then as time went on I just noticed the group chat became inactive.These are the same people who made fun of me behind my back all because I privately chided one of them (my closest friend) for being so carelessly ignorant about Covid. For context, vaccination rollout in my country is slow, transmission is highhe is living with a senior who in the past tested positive; and his sister tested positive for Covid twice too (she works in the hospital). So as a concerned friend I would tell him not to go out unless it is essentialand since we have a super close bond I did not really think about me being overbearing; we have been friends for almost 20yrs and this is how we are to each other.Once during a call, he let it slip that on one of his numerous dinners out he, being the jokester that he was, made fun of me with my friends for acting like his mom. And that hurt me because it was a private matter, and now he has painted me as this kill-joy, paranoid person. And that gutted me.it is one of the reasons I started to feel distant from that group, and when they started to be cold after I told them how I would been struggling with my mental health, that settled it.I am sorry for ranting. But I feel absolutely alone. They were my closest circle of friends, top tier. And then I am shunned just because I am no longer fun to be around with.It feels like we are all in high school again when I would feel anxious or depressed, and they would choose to hang out with our other classmates who are louder, extroverted, and down to play whenever.Depression sucks.

The past couple of years though it started to take over my life and cripple me in every aspect. I have built a decent comfortable life with a beautiful house, a dog that we absolutely adore, decent reliable vehicles, decent job, lots of friends to go out and have get togethers with. All with a beautiful supportive wife to enjoy it with. I do not say all that to brag, just to show some perspective I guess. I have all I could theoretically want or need, but yet I was so depressed that I dreaded waking up every day. I would lay at home by myself and drink and stare at the ceiling for hours just absolutely miserable for no reason. I started to self medicate with alcohol because it seemed the only thing that helped. As long as I kept a buzz going, I felt a little better. Of course this led to a vicious cycle of alcohol making my depression worse, and me drinking more to treat my depression. I started to drink all day on most days. Not getting hammered most of the time but drinking just enough to ride that buzz to feel a little better. I could not muster up the motivation to go to work allot of days. Luckily I have a very lenient boss and a decent amount of PTO at work or else I would have lost my job a year ago or longer. It felt like the end of the world to have to get up and go to work being in such a miserable state already, so I became known as the guy who calls out all the time. He is lazy and does not want to come to work. Some days I had to get drunk just to be able to numb my head, to be able to go to work, so I started drinking before work almost every day. I had brain fog so bad that it almost felt like depersonalization disorder. could not think, could not concentrate on what people were saying to me or on a task that I had to do. My short term memory was so bad that everyone of my friends and coworkers began to notice. (I once asked a friend if he had ever ate at this new restaurant, to which he replied dude I was literally there with you yesterday.) I suffered for so long like this without even talking about it with my wife. I could tell she knew something was wrong but we never talked about it. She was always supportive to which I am so thankful for. I tried everything to try to get out of my depression. I started researching and reading books on depression and different types of therapy that is used for treatment. I changed my diet a couple of times. Cut this out or that out. Cut back on drinking. Take a daily vitamin. Natural seratonin increase pills. Started working out 6 days a week (which actually seemed to help more than anything else I tried.) All of this and I was still depressed most of the time. I would have a day or two out of the week that were good days, if you could call it that. On those days, I would convince myself that I am just being lazy about going to work and that I am being dramatic. Everything is going good in life. You have no reason to be depressed. You have no reason to be depressed! I told myself this and was told this by anyone who I mentioned my depression to. I fucking hate that response so much. If I have no reason to be, then why am I so depressed then?! So three months ago is when my life finally started to change. I finally forced myself to go see a psychiatrist, after multiple appointments made and chickening out of going. He put me on the generic form of lexapro. I am sure you guys here are familiar with it. It started to help some a few weeks in, but I was still having good and bad days. We upped the strength of the medication and holy moly, what difference! I mean, I am now at almost an entire month without one single day being depressed. I have not called out of work. I am motivated and have been doing extra stuff that I do not absolutely have to do in my job. I have been more motivated at home, with keeping the house up and stuff. (Did I mention that I let my yard get so bad that I had to pay someone $1,200 dollars to come get it back to a manageable state.) I am actually starting to feel emotions again, not just dead and empty. My wife has noticed a big change in me as well and it makes me so happy that she notices the change. That constant feeling of doom and dread is justgone, and I am actually starting to feel like a human again. My drinking has also slowed WAY down because I am no longer using it to numb my feelings. I am still dealing with brain fog and some memory issues, but I am hoping they get better with time. I guess the reason for me writing this long story, that many people will not even bother to read all the way through, is to let anyone here that has been suffering and have not tried medication because of whatever reason know to Just try it! It may just change your life. Depression is hard and it seems like no one who has not actually dealt with it understands at all. It makes you feel like you are crazy sometimes. To anyone reading this, the way you are feeling is VALID and you are not being dramatic! Good luck on your journey through the darkness all! Lexapro saved my life!',\n",

Even though I have not lived a long time, I already experienced a long term relationship, sex, life abroad, college, and some recognition. I realize how lucky I had been for to actually tick off those moments. But my relationship ended because I became self-grandiose and deemed myself \"settling\" for someone below me, whatever the hell that meant at the time. My life abroad ended because I forgot or was too nonchalant to file in some paperwork crucial to my legal standing. I have realized my BA and MS degrees, even though acquired from top universities, do not mean shit, when there were apparently thousands of software programs that I should have been mastering instead of wasting my time passing a \"Introduction to Beer\" GE course in college. I remember I used to be extremely motivated and driven up until three, four years ago. I always deemed it my best quality, that I could find the motivation from within. But ever since those times, I have just kept falling further and further away from what a subjective optimal human life from should be. I find it hard to be motivated to do most everyday tasks. I have grown a dislike for people. I think I have finally realized the superficiality of modern society, or at least the segment that I know. And everything seems extremely pointless. I have not had a job since grad school, and have not had a relationship after my said breakup. I might just have grown lazy. Or I might be severely depressed. Now lucky for the leech that I am, my expenses are, and will be for some time I think, paid for. And if I do not make some stupid mistakes, like getting married or adopting a baby or starting a business, or in any way do not add anyone or anything to the payroll, I could retire to a small bungalow in the country and meagerly live out the rest of my life without working or engaging with the society.

I live with my parents. I cannot work at all and my disability claim was denied. I sent it in an appeal, hoping for the best. Its always hard being around my father. It seems like hes so disappointed in me and it creates a very tense atmosphere. Its easier to be around my mom but its still hard. My older brother blew up at me a few weeks ago telling me how lazy I am. He does not believe I have a disability. He was incredibly insulting. I blocked him but he apologized so I am talking to him again. Hopefully it will stay civil. My younger brother is nice but does not really understand my situation. I spend all my time either at home or at the park a few feet from my house. I tried to get gas the other day but was too anxious. I drove by the gas station and went back home. My mental health has never been decent. In 2013 my physical health began doing downhill. One issue after another. No help from any of the many doctors I tried. I smoked weed every day from 12 to 18 to try and cope with my issues. When I got sober a lot of the people I thought were my friends wanted little to nothing to do with me. College was terrible. I dropped out my senior year. Every year got harder and harder since my health was declining. Then I moved back in with my parents and it was doctor after doctor, protocol after protocol. None of it helped. It generally just made things worse and Id voice this to my parents and it caused more tension. I was kicked out of the house countless times and often slept at motel 6 with the money I had at the time. I have had such a bizarrely difficult life. I have been expressing suicidal ideation since 3rd grade. I keep hoping things will pick up for me and that Ill finally reach a place where I feel stable. I have hopes and dreams.

It was good therapy venting to myself anyways.7 months ago my newborn son passed away, 2 days before his 1 month birthday. He stopped breathing in his sleep, spent 9 hours at ER &amp; then passed away in my husband &amp; Is arms. I thought I was doing better but these past few weeks have been miserable. I was told prior to conceiving him (and after 4 miscarriages) that I had pcos and probably would never be able to conceive or have a pregnancy success. I found out two days before Mothers Day 2020 that I was having him &amp; I named him after Gabriel the messenger of God. He was the most amazing thing to ever happen to me and the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life. I wish every day I was the one who died instead of him.I am only 20 years old, yet I feel as if I have been through so much. I feel like God is punishing me in my life and I can never be happy. I do not understand why he had to cut short the life of a beautiful baby. I cannot eat, I am always tired, I am always reliving the moment my husband runs into our room screaming hes not breathing.Every night I fall asleep to images of what I think he would look like now. I am trying to conceive again to no avail. I want to be a mother so badly but no other baby will be like him, and my body will not cooperate regardless. I do not want to kill myself but I feel like I have nothing to live for anyways.He saved my from a severe eating disorder &amp; addiction. He made me grow up and turned me into a woman. I moved out, I got my shit together, my husband and I got married so my baby could have a happy home.I will never get to see him take his first steps, say momma for the first time, get to give him his first taste of sugar. I was so excited to take him to the beach, I bought a swimsuit that was several sizes too big so he could wear it in the summer. Its in his closet with the tags still.I sleep with his onesies in our king size bed. I wish it was him instead . I do not know why I am posting this, I have had Reddit for a long time and have never made a real post. Maybe I am looking for people to relate to or maybe this is a cry for help. I do not want to die but I want something to live for and I want a sign that my baby is okay &amp; watching over me. I wish I knew for sure. I think this whole experience has made me more religious because I know he was too pure and perfect to go anywhere else other than heaven and I hope one day I will finally be okay &amp; get to see my boy again. If anyone knows how I can move on or find some peace I would love to hear it. Thank you for reading this &amp; best of luck on your journey to happiness.

How can people do such horrible things, and why do none of the staff do anything to stop it? Why is prison rape so commonly joked about? it is not funny at all, it is a nightmare. I have never been to prison but I just cannot stop thinking about how soul-shattering that experience would be. I cannot stop thinking about how many people are going through that right now as I type this and about how they will continue to go through it for years or even decades. Endless suffering. I cannot stop imagining it over and over again.it is really hard for me to stop thinking about all of the agony that people and animals are put through, and everytime I get \"triggered\" like this it is like every horrible thing I have seen comes racing back to the front of my mind. I once saw a video of someone grabbing a piglet by his hind legs and slamming his little head against a concrete floor. Another of probably hundreds of baby chicks being stuffed into a garbage bag and suffocated. How on earth could someone do that to tiny defenseless innocent babies? My brain becomes overwhelmed with the images of these scenes and imagining myself in their place and wanting to save them and wanting someone to save me.

I just have no clue what to do anymore. My parents would be depressed if I were gone and my alcoholic sister would never even be able to fully understand it, who knows if she would even find out. After a while though everyone would heal and life would continue on. Maybe one or two people would visit my grave, but after then the trips would become farther and farther away until I am just another headstone. Who knows, would I even get a grave? that is expensive and I would not want my parents to have to pay for that. is not that crazy? We die and then we have to pay for dying. Fucked up. And even if I stay alive. Will anyone ever love me? When I was little I dreamed of being a single mom because I thought that it was more realistic than marriage.

Their comments are always homophobic , sexist, illogical , and it is also about me sometimes, which are generally misleading and wrong, even of my parents , they scold me for wrong reasons most of the time and the explanation I have , which might have / will change their mind ends up in my mind.it is not just about home , even in school , I am so shy , I am not able to answer anything or justify myself and end up getting scolded for reasons I was not supposed to.Some people might say just speak what is on your mind , how hard is it? , Damn it is hard for me , and I am not sure why , everytime I take a long breath to talk , I end up exhaling it and not talk anything.

When I was a kid, before I moved for the first time, friendships were easy. My best friend lived a few houses down and wed have sleepovers all the time. we did not have phones so we would talk and hangout during recess and on the weekends. and then I moved. and I was the weird new kid. it took me three years to make friends. and just when I started to fit in, we moved again. and again, I was the weird new kid. I would somehow find my way into friend groups that were already established. but because they would known each other forever, they never included me in anything. because I was not really one of them. I bounced around friend groups for 3 years. until I met the new weird girl. we bonded over how shitty moving was and we made fast friends. we are still best friends more than 10 years later. we made our own friend group and it was nice. but she graduated 2 years before I did. and the year after she left, my friend group changed. we took in two freshman that seemed to hate me for no other reason than I was the defacto leader. they thought they were hot shit and gossiped and lied and turned my friends against me. except one. and I was... okay. I had other friends and spent time on the sidelines in their friend groups. but then they all graduated. or moved. and it was just me and a school full of people who either hated me or did not know I existed. I was facing senior year alone and with the worst schedule I had ever seen a senior have. so I dropped out. cut off all my hair. attended the local community college to get my GED. kept my head down mostly. did not really make friends. after I got my GED I kept taking classes. nothing in particular, just general stuff. edged my way into more friend groups. again, they never made plans with me. but I was used to it. I did my own thing. and I was ok. I had a job then. and a semi decent boyfriend. I wasted two years in college and never got enough credits to even really count as half a year. dropped out. lost all my school friends when I stopped going to school. worked and spent time with my boyfriend. life was good I had my best friend who hung out with me all the time, a good job, and a semi decent boyfriend. and then we broke up. and my parents moved. so I moved. in with a man twice my age in a state id never been to. and he went to work in Alaska. left me alone in a house with four animals to look after, a job that gave me four hours a week and a freezer full of burritos. i made one friend that was a good friend. kept me company when I needed it. washed my dishes if I made him food. took me out places. he was probably the only reason I am still alive. then the man who is house I lived in came back. I somehow managed to get back with my ex in that time and I moved with my parents to another state id never been in. the friend who would saved me stopped texting. stopped responding. after six months of no friends and no job, I moved back to my \"hometown\" to be with my boyfriend. who kicked me out in less than a month. so I lived with my sister. and her two kids, husband and fil. slept on a cot in my niece\\'s room. eventually broke up with my boyfriend. worked too many hours in a job that sucked and did not have time or money to make friends. in a desperate move, I moved in with a new partner. to a different state. this one I would at least visited. I got a job. we had nice roommates. everything was nice. until my partner had a mental breakdown. moved out. left me alone where I could not afford the rent. so I moved across the country, back to my parents. where I live still. I have been here for two years. no job. a wonderful boyfriend who loves me and one friend. that never reaches out if I do not reach out first. never wants to spend time with me unless I ask. and suddenly I am back in middle school. a depressed fuck with no real friends, no motivation and a the biggest wish to have never existed in the first place. shitty friends are the worst.

       " 'I am 25 years old and I have never had a girlfriend, had sex, ben on a date, kissed, held hands, been touched by, been asked out, etc. I graduated college last May. At my on campus job I became friends with a girl who I eventually fell head over heels in love with.I have been in love with her since 2018. Was rejected and ghosted in 2020. She texted me last year to say hi, I answered and she never answered me back. I cry constantly and have been grieving every day for 3 years.The pain from never being able to be with her has made me suicidal and I have already attempted but failed to hang myself a few times. Its something I have to cope with every day. Its a sickness that never goes away. Its a pain that is not just emotional but physical. Again, I have been dealing with this every single day since fall of 2018.Something this is rooted in is my crush wrote poetry a lot and I bought a copy of a collection she published while we were still friends in 2019. In the collection tehre was a poem about her losing her virginity. Reading that absolutely destroyed me. It kept me awake for days. I could not stand the thought of someone else having sex with someone I loved so dearly and longed to care for so much. One day, she confided in me that her recent ex had been physically abusing her. More pain. Id fantasize about having sex with her but it would not help. I just imagined what it would be like if she actually loved me back and was attracted to me.Its getting to the point where everything related to having sex and relationships in general is painful to me. I even am starting to experience sexual dysfunction: I do not get aroused as easily amd I can no longer watch pornography because it upsets me to see people being intimate because it makes me jealous and depressed that the is something I have never experienced before. I hear people talk about their gfs and wives and I get extremely sad.I found out my 20 year old sister lost her virginity months ago and when I did I cried for days. I felt indescribably disgusting and pathetic. I am 25. I should have lost my virginity first. I should have a gf or wife by now. Everything related to sex and relationships makes me violently depressed. It ruins my day.I am so fucking sick of feeling like this. Every time I hear about sex i just think Yep, another person experiencing what Ill never get to experience. Everything and anything related to sex makes me want to kill myself.',\n",

       " 'Burner account for obvious reasons.It is so hard to have to seem like I am alright 24/7. Nobody asks me how I am doing. Nobody reaches out to me first. I could go days without meaningful conversation. My childhood was beyond fucked up. My father killed himself and my mother became addicted to drugs. My siblings and I were neglected. I was molested by another kid in the foster home that I stayed at for 2 months, and told nobody because I was ashamed that it happened to me as a male. My siblings and I stayed with our single grandmother for 2 grueling years until she could not take care of 4 children anymore. She sent my two sisters back into foster care, and for that I cannot blame her. I never got to say goodbye so I feel like they died, and there were suddenly less people who truly understood what I have gone through.I finished my last year of middle school and all of high school constantly hiding my depression. Some days are fine and other days are miserable. However, I never let it show how hopeless I was. When my grandmother and I would fight over the smallest things she took me to therapy for a few weeks of my junior year. She thought I had anger issues, but I truly do not so I got diagnosed with an undeclared mood disorder. I just did not want to open up too random stranger about anything. My uncle asked me once in my freshman or sophomore year of high school if I was depressed and I lied and said no. I have not opened up to anyone because, as a male, people are uncomfortable when we show vulnerability. I hate crying in front of others.COVID robbed me of the rest of my senior year of high school. I lost connection with the friends I was making and some of the friends I had. I have never felt more alone in life now than ever. I cannot remember the last time I left the house to spend time with friends. If I stop reaching out nobody will bother to check and see how I am doing. I live a meaningless life and I am expected to suck it up and work a full time job that I dislike very much. I am uncertain of what career path will help me most in my future. My grandmother ensures me that my time at her home is very limited and that it is not a safety net. I am very sure that I will end up killing myself in the near future. My brother already has bipolar depression, so I am worried that if I end my life he will suffer. I know that everyone else that has been in my life will forget about me soon after. They probably hate how closed off I am, but the primary reason I close myself off is to spare them from the pessimism that I keep inside me day to day. I am not going to burden other people with my suffering. So since I am I coward who cannot kill himself, enjoy the vague, depressing (haha) essay that I typed. I just wanted to get this out here so I feel less alone. do not reach out to me to tell me it gets better. Its a shallow phrase used by people lucky enough to have had people who care enter their life. Good for you. I might never come to check if my post was recognized because I really do not care. I just wanted to vent.Sorry for being self centered here. Sorry if some things made no sense.Sorry for wasting your time.I will not end my life anytime soon, but later most likely. I am 19 and already very tired. Thanks for reading I am going to off myself as soon as I get the courage.',\n",

       " 'How i lost my dad3 years ago, when I was 13 years old, my dad got in to a really bad accident. My dad who was a big sportsman was cycling home from work while training for a upcoming triathlon. Unfortunately he got by a drunk driver and broke his neck, skull, spine and almost everything you can think of. When i visited him in the hospital after his crash it was one of the most painful things I have ever seen. Seeing my dad laying on his bed crying because he tried staying strong for us but could not keep it together. I had never felt so powerless. In the following months after the accident, we all had faith my dad would become the man he used to be. The man who always was the guy I could on. The man who was always supporting me on the sideline, but unfortunately the situation grew worse as he got diagnosed with a serieus brain injury. He had to accept he had lost it all. His work (he could not and still cannot), his sports (cycling, running, swimming and his dream of finishing an iron man ( one of the toughest sport races in the world)). With my mom working full time and my 2 brothers being away from home a lot he did not have a shoulder to cry on most of the time. While at the time we all had hope his brain injury would start to decrease, the only thing I can hope for now is that my family stays together. Because of my dad being home for most of the time and being in a mostly depressed state, he is sleeping a lot the time and draining the energy of all of the family members. While we all love him as much as we did before the accident, the suffering of both ends is coming to a point where the bubble will burst. The pain I am suffering is in no way compatible with the pain of losing your whole life. But losing your dad while your sitting right next to him hits you in a weird way. He cannot take much and gets extremely angry at my mom about the smallest things, while the only thing she deserves is love and appreciation.

This is just perhaps a desperate lost call for guidance haha if anyone out here can relate/empathiseBasically I have had a really tough few years. I was out of a extremely tough relationship just before covid which I have found unbelievably difficult and then combined with all the isolation a year on from covid, I have really been experiencing a huge amount of sadness/depression and loneliness consequently, which has also extremely affected and shaken my self esteem quite a bit and I have lost a lot of confidence and easily get a lot of self-doubt about myself.

       " 'I have been reflecting on my life a lot lately, and I always find myself going back and thinking about the bullying I have dealt with through my life. Hopefully sharing my story here can get some outside perspectives and give me an idea on how to move on.So a little about myself, I am a introverted guy whose hobbies fall in Video Games, anime and music. I have been playing video games since I was 3 and they have been my major escape for most of my life. I grew up in a small rural town for most of my life (From when I was born to my senior year, am currently 25) and was actually a pretty optimistic kid in my youth, free-spirited and just looking to have fun and make people smile. My parents have been pretty decent, but they were never around to support me so I mostly just stayed in my room playing games. It was around the age of 4 the I first experienced any sort of bullying. A couple of my older cousins would pick on me for some of the games I played. (I was a PlayStation kid growing and they were Nintendo kids and around 8-9 at the time this was happening) Unfortunately nobody really stepped in to stop them but things never went beyond verbal insults.This went on till I was about 8-9 myself and they grew up enough to stop it and we get along on the rare occasions I see them. Elementary school was pretty uneventful as I mostly just kept to myself. Middle school was where things took a turn for the worse.In my 5th grade gym class we had to start changing into gym clothes and I never got the memo that boxers were even a thing and was still wearing briefs at this point. We were all getting changed and I realized what was up, got really nervous because I noticed everyone else was wearing clothes that I did not even know existed and went into the one stall in the locker room to change, needless to say the locker room was full of boys making fun of the fact that I was wearing briefs. It was at this point most of the male classmates in my class and the grade above me started just verbally making fun of me, and the female students would either just do nothing or tell me to not make eye contact with them.By the time I got to my 6th grade, I only had a few friends and most of them were not actually friends with me and ended doing some things to me. I was getting no support from family or teachers and was started to feel isolated, so I tried to fake being cool, which did not really do anything in the long run. It was also this year where I saw another student in my grade wearing sweat pants to school, and since I had some figured I could wear some. I remember walking into class and a few classmates giggled a bit amongst themselves. I went to use the bathroom at some point in the day and on my way back was stopped by a female bully, who proceeded to call me gay and saying wearing sweat pants is \"for girls\" and other verbal insults. This was the only time I ever cried in school for something like this.I feel like I had to grow up really quickly emotionally in school due to a mixture of all this bullying and teachers would also make me hang out with special needs students, even if I did not want to. In 7th grade I had a crush on another girl in my class (She was one of the only people in my class, let alone the school that actually treated me like an equal person) and some of my \"friends\" physically dragged me over to her after I let them know that I had a crush on her and made me grope her breast, all the while I was begging them not to. (Thankfully she did not hate me for this)8th grade was the first time I can remember wanting to die, not exactly wanting to commit suicide but wishing I could just cease to exist. I started to become really jaded, I could not trust anyone save for a few friends that I barely saw because I was too busy still trying to live this \"cool\" facade externally but just feeling so angry inside. Being exposed to all these people hating and belittling me made me start loathing myself too. Near the end of the year, the same group of \"friends\" from earlier pressured me into smoking some cigarettes that they managed to find. (I do not even remember where) I took one whiff, and in the back of my head I just said \"that is it, I am done with these guys, this is not what I want to be\"I left that school with one friend that I had just made that year, social anxiety and self-hatred from all the harassment. I remember that summer feeling really lonely, like I was just existing but I lost a lot of my drive and happiness.High school was better at least, there was still bullying, nothing compared to my old school but I think some people could sense my insecurities and would pressure me into saying or doing things, I tried to own this \"one man wolf pack\" loner sort of shtick but deep down I just wanted to be accepted. Things ended completely by Junior year but by that point the damage was done.Nowadays I have a small group of friends who seem to like me for who I am.

This past week I have been sick with a minor cold and while being sick it made me realize how much of a loser I am in life. I am currently unemployed and stressed about going back to community college knowing I lost my financial aid privilege from being a careless idiot in the past. My mom has spoiled me too much growing up and I took it for granted. It really hurts me to know I have not accomplished anything in life yet just to put a smile on her face. I had a job back in early May where I working a Physical Therapy Aide position but did not even last a month there. I thought I was doing fine until I got a phone call to not come into work anymore. I cannot even hold down a job ffs. No one in my family knows I got fired yet, too embarrassed to tell them. I do not think I have lasted at any job for more than a year. I have been applying to a few places, but no responses. I think I was meant to be a loser in life. Today was the first day I broke down completely in a long time when I came into a realization that I have pretty much 0 growth since I graduated high school back in 2017. Since middle school, I always had low self-esteem. I never tried to man up. I was lucky enough to be in a 5-year relationship w my high school love. My low self-esteem issues were the reason we went our separate ways when I would always decline invitations to do activities with other people. it is weird bc I do weight training at the gym every week since I was 17, and you would think that would build complete confidence, but the self-esteem issues are still there. I wake up late everyday in my same depressing room, open up my laptop and watch useless youtube videos, gym, come back home and do the same thing. I really have nobody to text or socialize with besides my sister. I would say my older sister is my only friend at the moment. She graduated from college a few years ago and works a job related to her career. She always gives me advice, but I would brush it off bc I am too pussy to completely open up to her.

       " 'I figured I would rant in a depression sub more than anywhere else. I always feel like I should not have any real reason to be depressed because I live in a first world country where there is an abudance of opportunity for anything you want. However, I have feelings of self-doubt, pity, anxiety and a general low self-esteem most of the time. I am 23 years old and I hate my life. I graduated in Mechanical Engineering in August 2020 and I still have not found a job in my field. This is partially the reason why my depression is bad. I have never had a girlfriend in my entire life and the last girl I tried to talk to ended up ghosting me. I do not particulary blame them either as it is my fault at the end of the day. I cannot beat the depression no matter how hard I try. I have followed every piece of advice I can take such as exercising, eating well, sleeping 8 hours a day, getting sunlight and I still feel like a piece of shit more and more. I would believe this might have to do with childhood-teenage trauma that I have had. My brother was not the best person in my life, which sucks becasue up to when I was 13 years old, he was amazing and awesome. Afterwards, he would because me a lot of physical abuse and mental abuse. He gave me two black eyes in school which many teachers would question if I was okay at home. I was not but I did not let them know that to protect my brother from receiving a bad reputation. I told my parents, but they did not really do anything about it besides a stern talking to my brother. He left me in -15 temperature one time for a few hours where I was just wandering the neighbourhood (I live fairly far from any store so I did not really have a shelter). The thing that makes it worse is that he has a successful life with a loving wife and amazing friends. It makes me sad that people can harm others and still never receive any karma. The next factor is the amount of bullying I received as a kid from my former friends. Surprisingly the ones who became my bully was my friend. This friend is very charismatic and good at getting friends himself. Due to my shyness and having virtually no backbone, I became a really easy target when we started highschool as he was able to convince other kids to bully me as well. The bullying was not anything crazy, just name-calling and making me look dumb a lot. However, they did this every day and it ended up taking a toll on me. These kids are also super successful now and have great relationships. I realized more in University how pathetic and below average I am to my peers. Everyone else can do things much more easier than I can, have much more talents, and are generally smarter than me. I have extreme social anxiety and I always struggle showing my persoanlity around others. Maybe it is a defense mechanism and I will be betrayed again. (Some Good Will Hunting type of shit lol) If it was not for TV shows and the internet, I would be a lot more depressed than I am now. I honestly believe I am a burden to everyone around me and my parents are making it more clear that they do not want me around since I have not obtained a job in my field and am sorta just coasting in life right now.

I not only learned how to communicate with other people, but also to control my \"explosions\", when it all got too much for me from all the information in my head I exploded (screaming, swearing, slamming with doors). I am very thankful for this and it has allowed me to be socially semi-functional and make friends.

I have been working towards improving my symptoms, and I do see a steady improvement. A few months ago I could not sleep for more than 3 hours. Falling asleep was almost impossible. My anxiety shot through the roof, as I was having daily panic attacks (a new thing for me). I lost my job, went back to school and got my degree. I am worried all the time. I ruminate all the time. I was bedridden for a few months and I lost about 50 pounds. My muscles have atrophied. My teeth rotted as I was not caring for myself. I am in a lot of pain physically and mentally. I cry multiple times a day sometimes uncontrollably. I will be 30 in less than a year and I feel like I am already dying. All I can think of is the negative, even though I have some positives. I am relatively healthy, no serious physical diseases.I have an amazing and beautiful girlfriend. I love her more than anything and she always returns the love tenfold. She has been trying to support me during this very dark period and I feel horrible for dragging her down. When the depression and anxiety were at their peak I was considering suicide every minute of the day. I had to call the suicide hotline and the lady I talked with used a tough love approach which actually helped put things in perspective. Anyway, even though the symptoms have been improving things keep happening in the middle of my recovery that trigger the anxiety and depression. Just yesterday when I was feeling quite good about my situation, I became the victim of identity theft. Here we go again. One step forward and 10 steps back. I obsess about things, and it has been driving me crazy. There are compounding problems contributing to this hole I have dug besides my mental health.

       " '(Idk what subreddit to put this in, so I decided to put it in here)Why is it that when someone admits that they may have a bad characteristic, people admire it? They are impressed that someone can admit to having a weakness. Such as being too sensitive, or too inconsiderate, too myopic, too loud, too shy, etc. In general people are impressed that others can admit a weakness about themselves. People admire that you can admit fault and be able to constructively criticize yourself.Now, once you start talking about physical attributes such as being too skinny, or too fat, or not good looking enough its becomes a matter of self esteem. Not a matter of constructive self criticism, its now that you are insecure. They tell you that you need to think better of yourself. That your looks do not define you. \"Work on your self esteem\" or \"You sound insecure\". Why cannot I just peacefully say or admit that I am not good looking? Or that I am not in anyway physically attractive? Why does that make me insecure acknowledging a fact about myself? I know and I am reminded everyday. I can see how I am treated differently as opposed to conventionally attractive people. I know that I have never been liked romantically by anyone. Why cannot people accept that instead of invalidating me and saying I am too negative or that I am just *insecure*?I am not asking for pity or for validation. I just stated a fact that I have observed about myself. If it makes you uncomfortable so be it. But you would be fine if I admitted that I was not outspoken, or a good problem solver right? I would not be insecure, I would just be someone who wants to be better. I am not insecure, I am also not blind. I see myself in the mirror everyday. Pretending that I am attractive is not going to change anything. So stop. Insecurities',\n",

I knew the place, my boss was very understanding (regarding my shyness, anxiety etc), I was good at it, I got my first salary and the first car etc : Things were getting much better.I did not move out because I was working part time, meaning I was not earning much, and I chose to prioritise spending my little savings into a car rather than an apartment.

My depression got worse over time and now I am do not care about what I say, what I do. Not trying to be edgy, trust me. But I think I got to a point where I am dead inside and I do not care if people see it anymore. I have two friends (I met both of them here. Good people, I hope we can still talk, love ya), but I simply do not care about others. I feel no empathy, no remorse, nothing. I know, I should seek help and blah, blah, blah. But the world is just... I fought for my life many years. Tried to seek help, went to therapy, that kind of stuff. But I just cannot see any hope. I go outside and I feel sick. People is just so selfish, ignorant and not a single one of them gives a fuck about others.I worked as a paramedic for a couple of years, donated to charities, tried to be a good person. But the world took me down. I do not know, I think this might be it. This is my life from now on. Not feeling anything. Enjoying my loneliness and feeling empty at the same time. This is it. This is it... I do not know if I am starting to enjoy getting ghosted or just getting used to it. Becoming a cynical person pt.1\",\n",

So not sure if that is part of my trauma. ik I am not as strong as some people but that def added to part of my trauma.. anyways i developed a social anxiety and generalized anxiety disorder which hindered my ability to make friends, so i had like 3 friends max.. i only talked to them sometimes too, not even close friends because of my anxiety and lack of motivation. i would spend all day playing on my laptop when i was a bit younger because it was an escape for me. I could just avoid my life and play video games all day because my parents are lenient. I started developing a depressive disorder, probably because i also started smoking weed about a gram a day of some strong dispensary weed for about 3/4 of a year. My brain was fucked i could not think at all, could not concentrate on anything for more than like a minute, hell i could not even concentrate or remember like anything from like the past day or two.. I was contemplating just starving myself to death because i did not know what the fuck to do but i realized that there is other ways.. not at the time.. but now.. i got a nurse practitioner who gave me Citalopram(antidepressant ssri), and recommended counselling and i accepted the counselling at the time. I declined later on when i got a phone call from the receptonist to make a counselling appointment or whatever, because i thought i was feel better, and i was. the side effects sucked. no sex drive really and insomnia. then i started smoking about a gram a day again which in about 5 days i went into a psychosis and got extremely anxious, agitated, panicky, and even yelled at my parents and told my mom to fuck off because she thought it was just anxiety and i knew it was not. Anyways she was broken inside because of her anxiety disorder and she could not handle it. I am out of psychosis now and looking into antidepressants again with something to help me sleep.

I lost a huge amount of my memory power, like if I have dementia, it is the most annoying shit. Because of that, my brain decided to go full on stupid since 6th grade. The funny part is that i get reminded of that a lot, in school for instance, people know I have autism (asperger) and they ALWAYS expect me to be some kind of genius and then get disappointed right in front of me (one big reason why I hate human beings). I also lost all the human fear of death, like, in 2017 i got threatened with a knife by the bully I beated the day before. He came from behind me (that is what sh-) with a sharpened knife touching me while saying he would kill me, and I said that he should do it fast then because if i got that knife I was going to pull his guts out with it.

       " \"Remember that all we have is 'on loan' from Fortune, which can reclaim it without our permission - indeed, without even advance notice. Thus, we should love all our dear ones, but always with the thought that we have no promise that we may keep them forever - nay, no promise even that we may keep them for long. ~ Lucius Annaeus Seneca (Cannot find the source)The most sobering thought is losing what we care about. Would we be able to move on, survive and flourish without our loved ones, whether they have passed on or we have? Some of us, I think. I can say that I have experienced enough of loss to understand that life goes on with or without me, and I can say that I would feel a pang of sadness whensoever their memory comes to mind. But I feel I would do this survival thing just as well if not better after that loss.I would not sully their memory by grieving them for the rest of mine. I would remember them by being better than they remember, so that, should we reunite wherever the universe decides we do, they would enjoy seeing me again, and sharing in my joys instead of my sorrows. I would like to imagine that this is how the old peoples did it.Bare with me, I have a silly idea that maybe, when the Norse, Greeks, Egyptians, Celtics and more, spoke about the idea of death, and what it was to live life after (because surely they did), they sat around their grand tables, talking of stories they heard as children, told to them by their parents, who were in turn told by their parents, and so on until the first story was made up in an answer to the age old question no one can answer. What happens after death? On a side note, I like to think the first story ever came to existence because a a child had asked this in front of the elder of the tribe, who had made his living from leading the tribe that trusted him. This elder never would have led his people wrong, and they would have led a happy, content life. This elder would be the one the whole tribe went to for advice. So of course, he did not want to let the child down. So he told a story. Something from his dreams that were impossible. And he took bits from others dreams and weaved a world after death.And people believed it. Because the elder never lied to them. The elder always led them in the right direction. The elder had lived the longest so the elder knew more than they they. The elder experienced the most out of them all. The elder would know. So they added to his story on death, and made up the gods, and the fantastical dragons, and other beasts of lore. They made up their magics and prophecies. All chasing after their own form of heaven after death, while others would forever be stuck in a hell of their own making. So that is how we got these gods and myths and legends. And that is why stories are so powerful, especially for a child's imagination. The fortunate child who does not fully understand the idea of loss and death, and is fueled on bedtime tales. Until they experience it, of course. And then they have to rely on what is told to them by the elders they know, and they carry that with them. And so it creates a ripple effect, their idea of after life pervading into all that they say and do. And that is how they cope with losing loved ones. They tell themselves over and over again, they are in Odin's hall, or at Arthur's table, drinking their mead and telling their tales of glory. Being happy. So if, after you die, you go to join them at the table, and they want to hear your tales of glory, would you tell sad stories about how you have missed them, and how your life fell apart after they left you, and you got worse and all these bad things happened? Would you tell you them that you have lived poorly because they were your only reason for being happy? Or would you tell tall tales of how you fought the bad dragons of the world just to make it a better place for their children, for their loved ones, and for yours. Would you tell them that they inspired you to new heights. You did they things they did not get to, and you can tell them what it is like. To do the former is to blame them for their death, and how hurtful is that to someone you loved? To tell them that their death, their inescapable cycle of life, made their loved ones lives in this already inescapable hell we live in, worse.But to do the latter is to truly put them at rest, at peace. knowing that their loved ones have thrived without them, have lived and have known a great amount of joy after the universe has given you your time. That they have made the world better, have made life more fun to live. Or at the least, have a good story to tell. To bring it back, I want to dissect what I feel is the most important part of Seneca's statement, that we should love all our dear ones. We do not know when we will lose them, although if you are losing them because of your actions, you should be well aware of those consequences. So while we share our lives and experiences with them, we should show our love for them. We should share our joys, and try to be better for their sake, if not our own.After all, No one wants to sit at a table and share drugs with the inconsiderate, deceitful, abusive, prideful, greedy, and murderous. I do not think I need to explain why. Live life Loving, and you will love after life\",\n",

English is not my native language (I am not from English-speaking country) so I apologise if you find harsh mistakes in my post or if I mention something inappropriate for this particular community or in general (if it is something really important please let me know and I will fix it). Also, my username was suggested by Reddit.As it says in the title, I am a 21 years old male. I have been living with my grandparents basically since I was born. The desicion that I would live with them instead of my mother was obviously made when I was not really conscious about it. I still have my mother but I do not want to live with her and she does not express a will for that either, not that I would take this offer. I do not even want to talk with this person.With these things said, I am moving to the problems I have. Now I will mention the ones that, while still affecting me in a negative matter, I do not see as primary but rather as secondary. Saying that I mean that I can live with them or even try to deal with them in my future by myself. They are here just for a bigger picture, not much else.1. I 100% have extreme social anxiety. This is why I was not able to continue my study in university. Well, not only this, actually, but also because it was not free and also I did not see any perspectives with my anxiety working a job that would require any social interaction, which means any job outside of the Internet. I found a way around it, so this is dealt with. I just have to study for it and I should have some possible income in future working online.2. I have zero friends. Like, absolutely no one, even online. It makes things harder, but I learned to accept it, and now I think I do not even need them. But that is why I am writing my problems here.3. I do not think a therapist will help me. As I continue, I think you will understand why I think like that.And moving on, here is the primary problem I would like to receive an advice on:I am afraid that I HAVE to live with my grandparents for the rest of THEIR lives. I am the only person living with them right now, and all the people from my family have their own little 'families'. The reason because I think they would not be able to normally live on on their own is because of their problems. My grandfather drinks alcohol every month for 1-2 weeks straight and of course this causes stress for the whole family (but no one is able to fix it), mostly for my grandmother. She has a form of cancer, having which life can be sustained mostly without the need of hospitalisation, though she still needs to be in a hospital every 3-4 weeks for a week. You could notice the similarity between times when my grandfather drinks and my grandmother goes to hospital, but I have to tell you these facts do not have much to do with each other, he was drinking all the time before my grandmother was revealed to have cancer anyways. Well, hearing all that, I do not seem to be a good person, right? Like, being raised by my grandparents and not wanting to express some gratitude? Yes, and I do not feel like I am a good person either. I do not want to blame everything on the others, my fault is also big here.I did not have a bad childhood. Neither a good one. I do not remember much of it, even being only three years out of it. But there is not a single good thing I remember from it, only bad and embarassing things. My grandparents did not make a normal attempt at trying to raise me, I feel like I was raised by myself. Just providing me with food and roof until I magically become an adult. And I did not ask them for anything either, I did not even have a smartphone before I entered university when it became a nessecity. Graduating from school, I thought I would kill myself, but I did not. It was more than a thought and a little less than an attempt. did not have the bravery. Thinking back on that, it was pretty comforting, not trying to improve anything in your life, thinking you would be dead anyways when life strikes you with the need to become a socially acceptable person.Yes, I am an egoist. I want to live by myself, for myself, alone. In a crappy apartment, with no real life contacts, working online and only going outside to buy food. I would even be fine if I had to give 50% of my income to my family if the other 50% can pay me for rent and food. I am sure I would be happy this way. What, is there no place for egoists in our society? Do I have to live the same crappy life all my damn family is living? Or is this just me being depressed about my life, who does not understand other people, who are not depressed. Like, what THESE people are living for?The moment that made me write this post happened a couple of days ago. My grandmother knocked on my door and said that she was screaming my name several times and that she did not feel well and needed me to bring her water. I think I was listeting to music that moment, not really loud (I can understand now why I am not listeting to music at higher volume, it is the moments like this). And my grandfather was unconsious from all the fucking alcohol at the time. The only thing I said to her was that I would hear her if she was screaming. This was literally the first time she was feeling like that in several MONTHS. I feel like I do not have a single minute to relax, I am always stressed because something like this can happen and I always can be interrupted even if it is not shit like that. Like, I feel that if I just tell everyone to fuck off and let me study in peace, I would have much more motivation to actually study and not stare into the fucking screen waiting for something to happen. But I cannot do that. I did not make an impression of being such a person. I act like I am fine and everything is fine. Not that someone actually cares if I am fine or not.You think if I am saying all that I actually did consider asking them if I can move out in future or not. I did not. I am afraid to. But I think that they will that I can. What will happen then? Currently I am the only helping my grandmother in our huge fucking garden and I did a lot of work there by myself. Her health is progressively worsening, and my grandfather continues to drink alcohol. So the things are going to get even worse without me being around.I would love to be a person who would say 'fuck all of that'. Can I be that person? What should I do? I ask these questions mostly to myself, but if you read that far into my post I would be happy to hear your opinion or advice on my situation. Thanks. 21M and need an advice\",\n",

I have been like this I was a little kid. but what is happened over the past few days just made me feel so low.My family were basically just my brother and sister. My sister now thinks I am backstabbing her for leaving. I tried to explain but she got over sensitive and angry, it is for the best. We were living in a 1 bedroom small flat. She was annoyed and unhappy over time. So I decided to leave, but she was not having any of it.So I got the bus an hour away from home to student accommodation. I got off the bus, ran to the bathroom and took a panic attack. I was there for 45 mins. Left walked round town and checked in to the accomodation. did not eat anything just spent most of the day annoyed and crying. So I was sitting for hours last night and this morning just anxiously looking to click that 'call' button on the support line. I explained my situation. They asked questions, asked about my GP and I agreed to have another assessment. They said it was a suicide line, but I have dark feelings, I feel hopeless alot, pretty much every day since I was no age. But I could not bring myself to end it, I just want the pain to end.It felt ok taking the first step. I know I needed help for years. I do not know what to do with the sister situation.

I dislike going to work, I dislike the babies, I dislike the parents. there is no passion there at all. I just never want to be there. However, I am not sure if I even remember what its like to feel anything other than what I constantly feel, which is nothing. I am worried that this is baseline for me. I would feel so much better if I was actually going through depression or something because then I know that my life can feel better. I am currently in the job market looking to explore different nursing jobs, away from bedside that I might enjoy. I am looking into working for an insurance company to do utilization review. I have an interview today and I am nervous because if I do not get this job, I have nothing else lined up and I definitely will become depressed if I am not already. We recently bought a house that I am waiting to close on in about a month, our current living situation also contributes to my poor feelings about my life. At this moment I just feel very unhappy. Everyday is a struggle. I just need good energy. Thank you. I hate my life',\n",
       " 'Anyone else have immense trouble concentrating on shit? Can I ask how do you cope with it when you need to concentrate? I have clinical depression and my doctor tells me that concentration is one of the last things that improve when you get better. I do have my studies however, I love my major and studying and learning new things but I just can not fucking concentrate. One of the few things that bring me joy is learning new stuff but when I open lecture materials its like I have forgotten how to read. Nothing makes sense and I cannot remember anything I read. I could not even bake a cake for my birthday alone, had to have mom as help because I could not concentrate on the recipe. This fucking illness has ruined me. I used to be whip smart and very studious and had a bright career ahead of me. Now i can barely manage university courses. This fucking illness has ruined me. I have tried to be on my meds and without my meds. If I do not take even just one of my multiple meds my head just becomes so \"noisy\" and full of shit that concentrating on anything is even harder. If i take my meds the \"noise\" and all goes away but then its just the emptiness there that is keeping me from focusing on stuff. I know recovery is a long process but I am scared ill never recover or get my concentration back. I am really frustrated trouble with concentration',\n",

       " 'Last year I got into music production and i quote it as the happiest year of my life.I was working on music 6 hours a day (at least). I once managed to pull off working for 12 hours.I really loved what I was doing , but this year..its different I do not know how.I am just lost , I can barely work for 2 hours and worst thing is games are back into my life. In 2020 everything that could possibly happen that is good to me has happend. I lost all my weight and got on some serious muscles all by working from home. I had such a mentality for work that year , it was ahead of everything.Back then I loved music so much I managed to not play games at all , I once did not boot up anything for 2 weeks straight. Now , I play games almost everyday (for 2 hours or so) and the worst thing is this fucking game Hearts of Iron 4 got me hooked onto it but it did not made me political. I just remember the days when I was a fat piece of shit and was playing that game in 2016 and I get anxious about all of that coming back right at me.I even uninstalled the game few days ago in hopes of my work hours going up but it did no such thing.What I am trying to say is that I lost the working spirit and I do not know how , I am genuinely not a lazy person.There is a person in my life that is stressing me a lot , I think about it everyday and it does bother me.I do not want to talk about it but I do want to meantion it , I was mad at the same person last year but I was still managing to work very hard.I am not suicidal nor do I think about it , just trapped in an endless loop of anger towards myself.Feel like I am in a minefield , that I have to look at every single step I take.There is something to meantion though , I have quit drinking coffee and any unhealthy drinks (energy drinks , coca cola , pepsi and alike) for 6 months now.Those drinks gave me the ability to stay up at night and make music , which was perfect because every producer encourages that , its just like magic when you work on music while your brain is half dead.But now I cannot make it past 10 , what is interesting is that I can play games untill 1 in the morning but not make music and that is 1 of the many reasons I hate myself. What is wrong with me',\n",
       " \"If you read the title read it once again.What I am saying below is depressing but it is not a lie.Does anyone feel like they are never living in the present, I sure do. I live my life chasing hopes and solving problems I have mostly caused myself, trying to better myself everyday and becoming someone I should be in my own mind. But there is always that thought that everything could end in a matter of seconds and I know that is very possible to happen.So that leaves me with this mission I feel I will never solve, if I am chasing all these dreams and always trying to become someone I want to be. What does that make of myself today. Would I ever be at peace in death if it were to happen today? Or would i be on my mission still, trying to become the perfect version of my self which in my head has existed many times. But yet I would always judge my own thoughts and feel like I should do 'better' even when I have reached a goal that I once visioned to be the perfect me.I chase and I chase, I feel purpose in being something more than I am every single day, I tell myself I am not happy or i will never be at peace until I fulfil these visions. But each vision I see and claim I still feel the fucking same way, one thing ends and its on to the next to fulfil myself as the last vision was nothing more than a stepping stone in my own mind. It leaves me with the question that has surfaced during every vision I have ever had and that is would I be happy if I were to die today? Or would I be worthless as I never took the steps I told myself to do. Ill be fucking honest if you have related to what I just said it can only end one way, that way I have figured out today. The way it ends is in helpless hope for happiness and fulfilment, to reach the perfect version of yourself to be someone that you have dreamt of which will only be a fragment of the life you once lived, nothing more than energy from your own mind. Nothing to anyone else, nothing to yourself. Sure as hell nothing to the future of this world. We are here because we were born to be, lead upon a life of confusion and misled instructions. To be a 'human' the only species that could ever think and do for themselves as far as we know. Alone on this world and on a mission to become a superior race. To dominate this earth to conquer our solar systems. To become gods at the end of it all as far as I know in my own head.But that will not happen for a very long fucking time, all we are today is hurdles, paths forged by our own thoughts to lead us hopefully to a blissful fairytale of immortality, where we could all live with our loved ones and remember the best times of our lives for an eternity.The problem with that is that we are never living our best times because we are chasing and chasing our better selves to bring peace. Which is ultimately pain in the end.So to end all of this my final mission is to tell all of you that life is nothing, nothing more than a figment of your mind, nothing more than fake instructions to be what you are. At the end of everything you are alone, lifeless and empty, nothing more than a past present to the future and what will the future be? The same fucking same thing.We are all here to live and die. Everything single thing along the way may bring the slightest and I mean slighted change to the future of life. The rest of it is just a delusional thought you have created to feel some sort of peace in your life until you reach the end where you hope, hope to be in a fucking dream world Knowing all this makes me feel numb, worthless and non existent and if you have related to what I just said you would feel the same. But that is very likely to be what this life is. There is nothing else along the way other than false hopes and sad endings, I am sorry for myself for having to be here and I am sorry for everyone else that is on the same ride with me. We wish we were more but that is beyond us. This is the dark truth of the world. It revolves around energy and we are just feeding it until it ends its own fate.So enjoy the ride, fulfil every hope you have and never stop doing so as I am sure it will make this easier. If you cannot stop changing yourself the world will simply do that for you. Which is being in death before you are dead. The way I feel about life. (I will warn you this post is not going to be a happy ending)\",\n",

During this time my gf of three years broke up with me over Facebook while I was sitting in a hospital bed waiting for an MRI, my grandad had a heart failure and died within 12 hours, and a week after leaving hospital for the final time my Mother confesses she was diagnosed with breast cancer about a month prior (she survived luckily).It took two years of feeling sorry for myself to try tinder, and there I met the most amazing person I am now engaged to, they convinced me to go back to University but closer to home as the Uni I was attending had Campuses across the UK.And so I did, and had an incredible time, got to travel to other counties to tour, was lucky enough to work with an artist who I now have work with on Spotify (huge personal victory) and since have released music with the band I am a active member of which was probably the proudest moment of my life.

This makes me question myself, is it really depression who is making my task impossible or am I using depression just as an excuse to avoid work. I am confused, anxious and frustrated with myself all the time but since I am on meds, I am able to have a little control over my emotions.I think I had Depression since my teenage years but it was left undiagnosed. I have read so much on how to deal with depression and tried different approaches but nothing seem to work. Which reinforces my doubt that maybe I am faking depression as I can use it as an excuse as I am not making progress in getting out of it and maybe I like to stay in depression so I do not have to do any work. But at the same time I never tell anyone at work that I am depressed so maybe I am not faking after all. Everything is so confusing. Whatever this is, I do not think Ill ever be able to get out of this phase. I do not want to stay depressed but I cannot get myself out of it',\n",
       " 'So introduction I guess.. my name is Michael and I am 20 yo. I live in Slovakia though I would be surprised if anybody knew where that is located. And I am struggling with..I do not know maybe deppresion?The problems started like long time ago back when I was still a child. My mum hated the fuck out of my dad and for some reason my dad hated her too. My dad is like the typical stereotype guy who thinks that woman should be in kitchen taking care of her husband. He was and still is to be honest addicted to alcohol. I remember when I was a child and my mum had to go away for a couple of days that everytime my dad stepped through front door I prayed to god because I was always afraid that he arrives drunk again. I was so genuinely happy when he did not and I always hid in my closet when he did. In school I was not very popular. I am the kind of guy who thinks that if you have the means, if you have the option and ability to help somebody you should by all means do that. Of course people tend to take advantage of that. Everytime they needed something I would do it eventhough if it meant that I had to spent 4 hours doing their homework or writing an essay. Of course I was bullied too when they did not need me because why the fuck not right I deserved that. I did not have a single true friend everybody I considered to be my friends they insulted me and humilliated me most of the time and I did not like it. I was so alone that I just decided that I had to have a friend. And that is when my schizophrenia probably started.I made myself a friend. He is called Martin Ladec I even created him a facebook account so I could chat with him because I had always wanted to have friend that I could chat with on facebook. Everytime I was alone I talked to him. My imaginary best friend. It all started like nothing too serious every conversation I had with him always played in my head like I only imagined that I was talking to him because I had known that he was not real. But then I started talking out loud to him.. It just went like this I do not really know how to explain it properly. I just sat on the ground and started crying and telling him how I was feeling but after I was done talking I got up smiled at the spot where I had been crying and tried to reassure the spot you know like if I was Martin cheering up Michael. After some time I got better but then I started hearing voices it was around 8th or 9th grade. They were telling me how pitiful I was, that I should kill myself that everybody hated me. I started to feel really deppressed and it was not helping when the actual people were telling me how pitiful I am and how they hated me. So at the end of elementary school my mind was shattered like glass into so many parts. Part that wants to kill me, other part who argues with the first part and telling me to live, Martin and myself.Then the high school came and I found new friends..like true friends. I liked them so much and they seemed to like me too. There was this particular guy that I enjoyed spending my time with we had so much in common. He loved the same type of music I did, movies, TV series and so on. Of course I had fallen in love with him. I did not even realized that I was gay but when I did I just went along with it. But I loved and still I love him so much..I guess I was really obsessed with him. I was jealous everytime he went out with somebody else ( of course i did not tell him I am not dumb I knew it would ruin everything) I was thinking of him everytime I went to bed and everytime I woke up. He had a best friend, our classmate, and the three of us started hanging out a lot. It got to a point when we had like really deep shit conversation and I remember that the other guy ( not the one I love ) told me ( because he could see that I had been struggling ) : ,,The stupidest thing that a person can do when he has some problems is that he never tells anyone about those problems. Talk about it.\" and then the guy I loved said : ,,We are telling everything to each other. Tell us.\" And I told them because I believed in them. I told them about the voices and about Martin and everything. It went fine it seemed they believed me but of course.. shit had to get worse. ( for the sake of this the guy I love is : T and his best friend is : S)At one point I do not know what happened but S accused me of lying. He said that nothing that happened to me never really happened to me and that I like the attention I am getting because of that and I just want people to pity me. He told other guys in my class and so I became the guy who is constantly lying, exaggerating and deppressed. I never stopped talking to them though. I understood that this shit is really hard to believe. T was still my number 1 friend because he seemed that he still believed me. I started to love him even more. I have always had money I did not even know how. From insurance, when my grandma and aunt died and what they left me. So always when I needed or wanted something I had it. And he did not have the luck he had like no money. Like he was not poor or anything but when he wanted Converse for example he could not afford. And I felt selfish because I had the money and he did not so I felt like it would be really selfish of me not to buy things for him. I bought him those. And trousers. And jackets. And games on ps4 ( which by the waay I bought just so I could play with him ). I remember that once he told me how much he dreamed of getting a new computer but his mum did not let him have it. So I literally started building my own new pc for 600 eventhough the one I currently had was completely fine. The old one I had cost me around 500. I told I am that I had built myself a new pc so I can give him my old one. For free. And I did. I literally spent on him around 600 because I gave him my monitor because he did not have one and I had to buy myself a new one. And I still was so happy when I bought those things for him and gave those things to him. I loved him so much like this is probably the true love you know.Then last year came and it all went to shit. It was my last year on my school and we had a party the entire class after Stukova. ( Stukova is like the Ball you have in last year of high school. After Stukova you have Dozvuky where all students just drink a lot ). S dated my classmate but they broke up before Dozvuky. I was really good friend with S\\' ex at that time. I am not going to explain what happened exactly this post is long enough even without those details but basically S \" fooled around \" with two girls. Two girls his ex hated the most. She was really sad and I was talking to her the entire time. After Dozvuky and everything I met him and he told me that I really fucked up. He told me that I disgust him and if I feel hurt that I deserve it. He blamed me for something I did not do. He did not want me to explain to him and he stopped talking to me. In the same week every guy from our class stopped talking to me including T and I realized that he told them his version and they all feel same as him about me. It could not come in worse moment. I was feeling during this time deppressed a lot. I had a friend ( M ) She was like my best friend after S and T. She knew that I was gay and she knew that I loved T. Still she fooled around with him when we had parties. When I was there. 3 times. Everytime she did it she told me that she was sorry and promised me she would never do it again. And she did it two more times. One time i was in the same bed as T and M and they started making out next to me. It was the worst feeling ever because I loved him so much and she knew and still she did it. I was heartbroken and defeated and I started cutting myself. And then S dumped me because of the misunderstanding and every guy dumped me and I was alone again. Fortunately I am not that stupid and I realized that I coudln\\'t continue like this. I am proud of myself that I realized that I need professional help because most people cannot do it.So I started looking for a psychologist at first.Someone to talk to. I tried 9 different ones. And they all told me the same thing. Only time can help. I did the Rorschach test numerous times and still they were not able to find anything wrong with me eventhough my every goddamn answer was really deppressing, negative and not positive at all. I cut myself. I hear voices telling me that I should kill myself or the ones that hurt me. I created an imaginary friend. For fuck sake even I as a patient was able to realize that something is a bit fucking fishy about me. They did not help. One psychologist even tried to touch my thigh. So that much for proffessional help. So I started looking for a psychiatrist . I told him the same story and he gave me pills. Arisppa. It did not help. The best part is that I told him that I had told S about my voices and stuff and how I hurt felt when he did not believe me and accused me of being a drama queen and guess what did the fucking psychiatrist asked? \" Michael, are you telling me the truth? Do you really hear the voices or have you made this all up just to skip school or be different? To let people pity you?\" Is this even possible in modern world? in which fucking dimension would sane psychiatrist ask such a dumb question? I snapped and I started laughing hysterically after that. I was laughing at my place for good 3 hours and then I started crying. And laughing after that. Some people just insult those who kill themselves and say that it is selfish decision. I totally understand suicide now. I have problems I accept that. I wanted help I desperatelly needed help but everything is against me. In this world if you are not selfish bastard you cannot be happy. This world is not made for people like me. it is really easy to say that \" get some help\" because apparently nobody can help. Like I do not even know if anybody is going to read this or not. But if some lost sould read this entire novel to the end just wanted to let you know that do not worry I promise I WILL NOT kill myself. I tried sure but I am not strong enough to do that. Besides my paranoid me thinks that it would make other guys happy and I do not want to give them this satisfaction.Honestly I do not know what I expected from this. I do not know if I want your help because I know you cannot help me. But I tried everything. Psychologists, psychiatrists, telling friends, group therapies, fucking taiwan mantras to calm my mind, tropical teas and herbs to soothe my mind. Nothing worked so I just thought fuck it let us give it a shot. Maybe miracle will happen. do not know what else to do so I just leave it up here',\n",
       " 'Yesterday was the straw for me. My councillor had already advised me to try them because I just keep spiralling, getting a boost from our session and then it all going out the window before the next session. I do not have any fuel for the fire, I think there is something biological going on. After a vicious breakup and being just unable to make any ground for the last 7 months. Struggling with the constant voices in my head, minor jobs just being overwhelming have been the run of the mill.But yesterday I flat out insulted a close friend. The only one who had really been there for me. He got a girlfriend just as I lost mine. I am full of bitterness and resentment. I have always been a good mate, never want to step on toes. It was completely out of character and like watching a car crash in slow motion. Trying to push people away out of fear? Out of mercy because I think I am just draining to know? I have no idea.I verbally attacked him and his girlfriend who I have never met. Even talked shit because she had a kid with some else after they split and he went running back and looks after someone elses kid.But anyway, called the doctor today. Got some anti depressants to hopefully help. Really scared of losing my libido, but the horniness and want for my ex has also been torture. So maybe not a bad thing? Just less on my mind hopefully. Got my anti depressants. Absolutely dreading it.',\n",
       " \"So...I feel unsure about posting this because I am not sure if it is too good to be true... or maybe people will not believe me. But I think I am going to be ok and I want to share what I think really, finally worked. I have major depressive disorder, generalised anxiety disorder and C-PTSD from years of childhood sexualising abuse and violence. I drink too much, I hate myself. I have always had issues with needing an outside substance to numb that pain. Drugs, booze, sex.... you know how it goes. The last few months have beeny worst. I constantly thought about offing myself.Last December I contacted a clinical hypnotherapist about help to cut down my drinking. I connected with her instantly. We spoke about why I drank and my past came up...as it does when you have seen a many health professionals as I have and are used to going through the motions. She talked to me about a process called The Richards Trauma Process (TRTP). it is 3 sessions. Session 1: stop self sabotageSession 2: address and leave behind the traumaSession 3: set yourself up for the future. It does not retraumatize you. I have done EMDR, CBT and years of talk therapy and they all retraumatise. Who wants to go through those events again??I did not do anything about it until 4 weeks ago because it cost $1200 and I had quit my job. But I was finally in a position to do it.Between Sessions 1 and 3 I have gone from severe depression, severe anxiety and moderate stress to ZERO depression, zero anxiety and severe stress. We figured out the stress was due to my new overwhelming desire to take care of myself and being a mother of very young children... that is quite hard. So Session 3 we spent on managing parental overwhelm. Tonight my kids were little shits and I did not care. I was fine. I did not snap. I did not cry. I did not descend into a panic attack like I have so many times before. I waited for them, then we did puzzles and listened to music. Oh...and I went for a run this morning for the first time in months! I do not even know myself and it is insane to think about. Who even am I without trauma and mental illness. I think of my abuser and he seems insignificant. I look back on my trauma and it evokes no physical reaction. No knot in the stomach. No chest tightness. No heaviness in my body. it is as if I am looking into someone else's life. Not my own. I hope this helps someone. It has brought me back to life. TRTP - Holy shit.\",\n",
       " 'it is going to be a long one. My parents have a tough relationship and I am very used to them quarreling. Since when I am about 16, they got into a particularly big fight which I witnessed many arguments. Although they never fight physically or used foul language, the way my mum talks is extremely offensive, degrading and condescending. My dad tends to be the weaker one in our family and would be the one who compromise usually (though not easily). I did not realize how have all these affected me until I got into university (I am 21 now) and lived on campus, never once thought life would be so stress-free and peaceful without them.Since I am small, my mum stemmed the idea in me that I must compete for her love with my younger brother, and for a long time I disliked, even hated him, possibly because of all the constant competition and comparing going on. An example would be that if my mum and I are in an argument, she would verbally express affection for my brother and make sure I know she favors him over me. Although probably my dad and my brother disagrees with her actions, her long-time dominant role in our family made them turn a blind eye in these cases.Going back to my parents, in the middle of almost all of their arguments, my mum would definitely ask me to take a side and have to condemn my father outright. If I do not do so, she would make me a villain as well and I would have to apologize or get scold at later, although the matter of the argument does not relate to me at all. I hated to be squeezed in the middle of their fights and would often cry and scream for them to shut up. Very hurting words like \"you should just go die\" \"your dad does not want you anymore\" or \"it is all your fault\" still rings in my ear although years have passed after them. Probably a few months ago, I found myself getting extra irritable to noises, and not once I got so irritated I almost cried when a friend is talking to me (though I had a long day). I also noticing having more frequent thoughts of skipping social settings and wanting to just curl up in my bed. In addition, I also have stronger feeling than ever that my boyfriend would just leave me, again for no reason. (it is another question which I always ponder at, whether I am insecure in romantic relationships due to my family or past experiences, since my past bad experiences could be related to my family too? but that is for another day)Then recently, I cried in a restaurant eating with my parents since they would not talk to each other nor to me after quarreling about trivial matters. Even if my mum would respond to some of my questions, it would be expressed in a sour and rude manner. I just felt like I am being treated like shit for nothing. Sadly, although they both saw me crying, they pretended that they have seen nothing and carried on with their lunches in silence. I could not stop crying and ran away, which my mother came after me saying things like \"why do you have to make a big fuss\" \"you did not stand up for me when I was in an argument\", etc. I did not look back and went straight to my boyfriend.Days after, till today, I still have bad mood swings that made me want to cry in public, feeling empty anger that I do not know the reason of. I am tired even though I slept a lot and did not want to talk at all. I have been through phases like these years ago but never this strong. What is my problem and should I get help? What can I do in the meantime? Thanks for getting through this whole thing, as english is my second language, I hope the grammar is not too bad. Thanks all I think I have depression but I am not sure, can anybody help?',\n",

My dad found my weed last night and told me he was dissappointed, he said it is not a good way to deal with things. He said he cannot force me what to do or what not to do, but he trusted me enough and handed it back to me. I do not know what to feel about that. Right now, my dad is also having troubles with my mom, and sadly my little sister got stuck in the crossfire. My dad is barely talking to anyone like he used to. He does this very often. When he gets angry, he shuts himself off and does not talk to anyone. He probably has a mental illness of some sort, he is a very complex person. My mom once told him to go see a psychiatrist but he refused to because that is just how he is. He does not have a good relationship with his own father, which might be a because or something.I also recently got diagnosed with mild depression and anxiety and got prescribed with Lexapro. I have been taking them for a week now. My mother is the only person I can always talk to but I cannot tell her about the weed thing because I got caught before in school and she knew. I want to explain to my dad about everything but knowing that he is the person that he is, a part of me also does not want to open up to him. he is a sensitive person, something so slight can trigger him to the point of shutting himself off from his family. Smoking weed has always been that barrier between me appreciating life and jumping off a cliff. I do not know if I should continue smoking or not, I feel so guilty if l smoke because I know my dad is probably stressed about this situation also. I am pretty well known in my city, I know alot of people but that does not help either. I cannot trust anyone at all. I have only 2 real friends, my best friend and his girlfriend. I am so young, I do not know why I am feeling this way, it is so overwhelming. I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. I want to kill myself but in a way that noone would be sad about. I know there is people that care about me. My mom does. My dad does. My friends do. But when you are suicidal, nothing really even matter anymore.

       " 'Hi all,The last few years have been awful to me. Although I am 19 and at a very good university, life is so tough right now. I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, not because of any external factors, but just because me lmao. My family has always been fine, and we are close and supportive, and my friend groups over the years know what is happened.The past 4 summers, however, have been awful and I am losing everyone I love.3 years ago, I had a complete mental breakdown over my thoughts spiralling, and nearly committed suicide. I did not tell any friends about this, and was too mentally exhausted to socialise over most of the summer, and I lost many friends by just not seeing them.2 years ago, I broke up with my girlfriend. It was sad as any breakup is, but was made worse by false rumours she had made about me. We broke up just entering into summer break, and that summer was really tough. I worked on myself over summer, but I became very anxious about what everyone thought about me, and I lost a lot of my humour.Last year, of course covid hit, so we were in lockdown, which was isolating. Just to add fire to my already depreciating mental state, my dad was diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in April. Thankfully that is one of the safer cancers to have, but I would not ever wish the experience on anyone. Over this summer, he had rounds of radiotherapy and scans and it was so stressful. I joined uni later this year and, although I made a fair few friends, my dad was always on my mind and I could not enjoy myself as much.This summer, I have been framed for a completely horrid allegation, and the investigation process is so painful and mentally exhausting. I am trying my hardest to stay positive but it has taken away my social battery completely, and once again, summer has not been kind to me. To add to this, my dad had gotten a recurrence on his cancer, and his voice box had to be taken out, and he was in hospital for 2 months recoveringHas anyone else had years of just horrible stuff happen, and what advice can you give to try and get through all of this. Also, what professional help do you think would be appropriate (I have tried antidepressants but i did not like them) Sorry for the long read, but thanks How do you look past all of the bad things life gives you',\n",

But it just makes me wonder, how ironic it would be if it just broke appart and left me so much less than the little I am now, if hope and love just serve as entries when the main dish is always misery and hopeless, and I wonder, if everything falls appart again, will I just be someone looking for hope like an addict looks for his next fix or will I be lucky enough to never wake up again.

I did not respond at all because I am used to her being that way and you cannot really reason with unreasonable people. Then she proceeded to say that she will order pasta and some noodles and was staring at my face. My mom has been my first bully and has never understood me and so has the rest of my family. I love the foods she mentioned and she knows that I am insecure about myself and I will have to resist myself a great deal if she orders that. My little sister (18) chimed in and added to all this. She said she would also order things for her to eat. All the junk food imaginable. And all of them waited to see how did I react. I did not react and pretended like this did not happen. This is a pattern now, every time I try to improve they react very very negatively, I feel like shit at my house. I do not know what to do. I started my self improvement and weight loss journey today and my family absolutely brought me down.',\n",

       " \"Hi all, I went through a really bad bout of depression last year (about 6-9 months) I cannot overly remember it as it feels like a big blur. I would just be holed up in my room after I got home from work and would lay in bed for hours, not eating, just scrolling through my phone. I was living with two people at the time who I considered my best mates (they were aware of my struggles with depression - I was quite open about it with them) but this was the worst it is ever been around them. Throughout those months they moved on with their lives - got boyfriends, promotions etc. which I am incredibly happy for them (they are extroverted and neurotypical) but they took my depression personally saying I was not making an effort with the friendship and that they felt like they were 'walking on eggshells' around me - this is a major trigger for me. I told them several times that it was not personal and it is hard to get excited over someone else's life if I cannot even get excited over my own. This caused quite a big riff in the friendship &amp; I pulled back considerably because it was also setting off major anxiety for me. Because I never wanted to experience this again I started masking my depression around everyone I know. But I have noticed that when I am alone I am spiraling worse than before - I feel like I am about to fall into a serious rut and I am trying to avoid that at all costs. Has anyone had any experiences like this? Am I actually doing myself a disservice by masking my depression? I am scared I might lose another 6-9 months of my life if I do not do something.

I am fascinated by MBTI, Big 5 Models, Jungian Typology and all the things along the lines. I have focused very much on self improvement and tried to improve my skills. I figured out atleast acting like an extrovert tends to make social life a hell lot easier. But whenever I try to do this I just do not feel like myself. I kind of become numb among people which I only realise when I let myself speak to me often at night when alone. I think forcing myself to socialise and talking to friends is kind of helping in building my social persona but I just live by a philosophy that everyone is just alone in his life and as long as I do not fall into making myself vulnerable in front of people I am fine. I just do not want anyone to know the real me. And I guess the reason for that is because I have experienced and now firmly believe too that no one can ever understand me fully. I have tried explaining myself to people but I feel every friend/family I ever had just waited for their turn to speak if I ever talk about myself. Anyways the question is I am confused what part is me ?Should I keep myself happy and just keep living in my head and stop interacting to other humans. Because I literally just love living by myself. Or I should keep trying to socialise because I also believe that if I want to earn even a small amount of money I need to just develop my social game. Keep in mind every other human being including my family is just a person to me whom I can just never reveal my true self (talking about things I want) because whenever I have done it in my life people just go blank like it is a huge lot complex for them even to comprehend and believe me I have tried this way many times than you can imagine.

I do not understand myself first off, so it will be hard to explain my feelings to those reading this. I cannot exactly identify my feelings a lot of times. I used to feel true joy, the kind of joy where I felt alive and vibrant. I think I lost this kind of joy in about 8th grade or freshman year of high school. I now am graduating as a senior, and I still feel the same way. Its not like I am necessarily sad. I can feel ok, but i will never feel like the funny girl who could make someone light up from my jokes and personality like back then. I can never feel completely alive. I can never feel completely like myself. I guess along with this, its like I never feel truly happy? I am confused on when I feel happy or not. To be honest, maybe I am never completely happy. Its confusing. I would say actually that I do feel happiness, but its artificial. Its still really cool in those moments when I feel that type of happiness, but it just is not enough? Its like I cannot feel the same with people as I used to. I cannot bond with people the same. Its like I feel robotic almost in conversation? Not much emotion is there lol. I would say that with sadness, perhaps there is always a gloomy disposition lingering in the back of my mind. Maybe for so long, its so hard to identify it. For so long, I have also felt bouts of anxiousness. Even now maybe anxiety is apart of me and its lingering in the depths of my mind I cannot reach out towards because I can barely even identify it. At this point in my life I am just scared Ill be like this for a very long time, I simply do not know if I would want to exist if I knew Id be like this for the rest of my life. I already feel doubt in life, but its because I am so young and just getting into the world and discovering it that I have hope, hope that Ill change and that Ill go on to do great things and experience great things. I am so worried though, I am worried of different things at different periods of my life. It seems like I have new anxieties here and there while simultaneously feeling a sense of uneasiness always inhabiting the back of my mind I guess. I am just not me anymore. Life looks grey I guess. I guess its looked like that for so long that I feel odd even bringing it up, like perhaps its just not true because this has been my normal for so long. Sometimes I feel like I need mental help but then feel stupid because I feel as though maybe there is nothing much wrong with me, but what makes me realize truly that there is probably something wrong with me is the thought of staying like this forever. It makes me not want to exist anymore, and whenever I come to that realization, I immediately know something is not right. I remember whenever I was talking to a nurse about how I felt, but its as though she brushed it off as simply being my personality. It felt wrong, and I hope its wrong. I really hope I will not stay like this forever, and that its not just my personality. It does not feel like that. It should not be like that, you know? I think I should add that I was on Prozac since the end of my freshman year until I think the summer before my senior year btw!

One of my brothers is estranged because of an incredibly dumb situation that he completely cut me off since about 6 years ago. I have tried multiple times to mend that fence, to no avail. I just get ignored. Since then two of my mom's siblings have also passed, and one moved across the country. My other cousins have either stopped talking to me because of my brother situation or moved away, or I am quite a bit younger so we never really got together much.I have also heard that quite a few of them think I am snobby, because I am one of the only members of my family to graduate from college and I make great money. I NEVER shove that in anyone's face though, and I do not want any of that to define me. The only two members of my family I have really even seen outside of weddings or funerals is my other brother and my dad. As previously mentioned, my dad is not around and my other brother is my best friend, and we are super close. About a month ago though, he decided to up and move south with his family because he could no longer afford to live in MA. Obviously I support him and want what is best for HIS life, but I was devastated.On the friends front, I have never been great at having close friends. I had a really close friend growing up but over the years we have drifted apart. I have a decent group of college friends, but none that I see or hang out with often - except one - and about 5-6 years ago he moved across the country to be with the love of his life. I am so incredibly happy for the guy but at the same time, I felt such a huge loss. I am honestly not that great of a friend anyway. When I go through depressive episodes, I tend to flake a lot.I do have a spiritual community, but I am not particularly friendly with any of them. I am also much younger than about 90% of the congregation. Tldr - I guess what is bothering me most is feelings of abandonment. I do not want to be close with people because everyone I have cared about has either left me, cut me out of their lives, or died. I am really struggling with relationships, and the thing most depressing me right now is if I happened to die - whether self inflicted or not - who would even show up to my funeral? I do not feel like there is anyone out there that gives a flying shit what happens to me beyond my wife and my girls, and that really sucks. I just want to feel important and cared for, and I do not feel like I have any of that. I feel like my wake would be about 20 people and none of them would even give a shit about actually wanting to me there, and that makes me sad. Feeling incredibly lonely lately\",\n",

Obvious red flag, and I knew that then, but I had extremely low self esteem and thought it was a miracle that anybody would be interested in me in the first place.I thought that if I said no, Id lose her and be alone the rest of my life so I agreed. Thus began one of the worst chapters of my life.To keep a long story short(ish), naive sheltered me ended up introduced to hard drugs, got my shit kicked in by a meth head trying to rape my wife, watched her nearly die due to OD, wandered several states homeless, and got constantly reminded that she did not love me, but just married me to get away from her insane mom.She ended up pregnant and a few months after our daughter was born, she told me she did not need anything from me anymore and filed for divorce. She wanted me to just agree to disappearing from my daughters life, but there was no way in hell I could do that, especially since my own father disappeared shortly after I was born, so I fought it.Me disobeying her made her furious, so during the divorce/custody hearings she accused me of everything under the sun, saying I was physically/sexually abusive, a pedophile, that I trafficked her, etc. etc. She had nothing to support any of those claims because they were bullshit, but I was investigated by DHS and law enforcement three times, because she just kept making worse and worse accusations.In the end, she got full custody because the judge said every child should be with the mother not the father (were in a deep red state), and I got standard visitation. The next several years were their own nightmare that I will not get into because this is getting too long, but she constantly tried to poison my daughter against me and my family and was generally extremely toxic. Luckily, my daughter is smart and saw through the lies.Her mom re-married, had another daughter, then around the time my daughter was 8, she decided she did not want to be a mom anymore and just left to who-knows-where.My daughter moved in with me and we heard almost nothing about her mom until my daughter was 12 when we found out she hung herself.I have never cried so hard in my life, not for myself, but for empathy for my daughter.

On the surface, I feel like I have everything that anyone could ever want. I am a college student that is in a field of study that is reasonably suited towards my aptitudes, have a loving family, friends, and all the other hallmarks of a functional lifestyle.However, my feelings of dread are persistent and have plagued me since I was a young teenager. Even in grade school, I exhibited signs of clinical depression and hints of suicidal behavior that had no obvious justification. My family has done a wonderful job of providing me assistance during my times of need, and I cannot ever thank them enough for that. Nonetheless, I still feel this gargantuan, intangible misery draped around my weary shoulders on a daily basis.What I feel is not a crippling want for attention or unattainable goals, but a general dislike for being human. No matter how I weigh the quantifiable joy I have experienced in my life, it always seems frivolous at best in comparison to the weight of my sorrows. I perhaps feel so terrible that I feel nothing at all.On a primal level, I possess intense hatred and frustration towards my corporeal contract. I hate being human. I do not want to be me anymore. Why do I have to be me? The sheer pain I feel is indescribable, and almost certainly blocks out any fleeting pockets of happiness that I can extract from life. Even if all of my earthly desires were satisfied this instant, I would feel nothing but the phantom pain. I am bound to this worthless body and by the obligations I have towards the people in my life, and I cannot even fathom them ever understanding my plight. No one will. I am trapped.

I feel awful all the time, I have lost interest in all of my passions and my motivation is short lived. I am constantly surrounded by people who ask for my support but never actually show that they care, I have hardly any friends and the ones that do do not seem to care. Normally, I would be the supportive friend , but at this point i really cannot be arsed with any of it nor do i care about their problems anymore.it is getting harder and harder to put up with people's shit, I am angry at everyone around me but I am even angrier at myself.

       " 'Possible TW because its about self harm and mental hospitals ig... I really do not know where to ask this so I am asking here, if I missed something in the rules and its not allowed here please tell me! Ok so I am 13F. I was friends with this girl a couple years ago before we moved. Recently her family moved in with us temporarily until they can get on their feet, get a house and such. So its their mom, my old friend (11F), and her brother (9M). I am not really friends with her anymore, and am now more friends with her brother. Since we have become friends I have realized he is most likely depressed (though he has not been diagnosed) and has been occasionally harming himself. Not cutting, but scratching himself with his nails or sharp objects, but that does not make it any less worrying. I am also depressed, (I have been diagnosed, so my parent are aware) and have self harmed (still kind of am). that is one of the reason we became friends, because we could bond over our feelings and opinions. We have a group chat with his sister and had kind of vented there. She got worried apparently and showed our moms. They got really mad at us for talking about that sort of thing. Said it was inappropriate and we should have come to them if we were feeling like that. And his mom said if they were sad, depressed, or self harming that they would be sent to a mental hospital and would not be able to see her for months. No talk about the severity just in general, if they were or were doing any of those things that they would have to go to one.. We ended up getting grounded from our devices because of it. I know her saying that made my friend really anxious and uncomfortable talking about going to somewhere like that.Since then I have heard her say that and things similar to that (some in more detail) to my friend and his sister. I know it always makes him uncomfortable and upset. Idk would she be considered toxic or is she justified in saying stuff like that? (Sorry for the long explanation) Do you guys think my friends mom is being toxic?',\n",

       " 'This may be long, so I apologize. I am 29/F, married and a mother. Let me begin by stating my husband is about as supportive as he can be and my child is incredibly understanding. All this aside, my depression and manic episodes are beginning to get out of control. And I honestly, do not even know where to begin and truthfully my story is not one really worth sharing. I feel as though this deserves a disclaimer that I do not feel right sharing my sorrows as I see myself being more fortunate than others. But I am so lost that I feel this need to post something, rather than continue hovering over this sub and other subs related to mental health, depression and anxiety. Currently, I am on 20mg of Lexapro and 600- 900mg of Gabapentin per day. My father was an alcoholic, and my mentally ill mother suffers from bipolar disorder, depression and classic narcissism. I was raised in an extremely religious family in the Bible-belt of USA. My entire life up until 16 was immersed in the Southern Baptist culture. My parents divorced when I was 4, and I did not see my father for 17 years. During my upbringing, my mother and father managed to marry 6 people between the two of them. Somehow during the later years, my fathers 3rd wife managed to get him sober. We reconnected when I was 20 years old and 9 months pregnant. I suffered for years from mental and physical abuse by the hands of my mother and her 3 husbands between ages 4-18. Needless to say, my life centered around their instability. I was the oldest, and therefore inherently responsible for my younger siblings. Being in a violent home, the anxiety I suffered was not acknowledged. I was the girl in school that everyone knew had a rough home. My friends were my escape and still today remain my chosen family. But the fact of the matter is, they do not truly understand my situation. I gravitate towards people who are not nearly as jaded. I leaned on my friends parents for guidance and empathy. I have always been the black sheep of my mothers family. I am creative, incredibly artistic, intelligent, charismatic and I am not sorry about it. However, my family views me as strange and always have. I was always told how much I looked and naturally acted like my dad, someone they hated my entire life. I have absolutely nothing in common with my mother or her side of the family, and frankly, I am extremely resentful. We rarely speak unless its a holiday. I refuse to have my child around their toxicity. My mother is on her 4th husband, and just as manic as ever. My father, who I had so much in common with, died from alcoholism in 2017. After years of sobriety, he lost his film business and drowned his sorrows tenfold. His death was gruesome. He died alone in an old farmhouse, during the August heat in North Carolina. His body rotted for 9 days before anyone found him. I can still smell him today. His death destroyed me. After years of separation from my father due to his substance abuse, I was so happy to have him back in my life. But he suffered from his own mental health issues and lost himself. I miss him every damn day. Fast forward to now. My husband and I have been together since 2008. Our child is 8 years old. I promised myself that I would NOT repeat the cycles of instability and abuse with my own child. I am proud to say I have kept that promise. My husband and I have always put our kid first, including making the decision just to have the one child in an effort to provide the best life. we have done it all. We bought a house in the suburbs of a great small town, we are part of the community, provide a great education, we are not religious, and we make sure that our child has an active lifestyle both in and out of school. We both work full time and I am a part time college student. Our vehicles are paid off and our debts are very minimal. Life is great, right? Here is where my own mental health issues come to light. I suffer from clinical depression and panic disorder. I see a physician regularly and have been on my own medication for a little over a year. My job is incredibly stagnant and in such a toxic environment. Every day I dread this job. I have been there 5 years. Now that I am educated, and have consistent years in a particular industry, I feel confident moving onto a better paying position and hopefully a better workplace. I have been job hunting for four months. The job market is terrible and the competition could not be higher. I have never been so rejected in my life. My car is beginning to fall apart and I cannot afford to fix it, or purchase a new one. My studies can be overwhelming at times and my professors this summer in particular have been hard on us. I have a number of hobbies, including a podcast and I am so lost. My depression is so out of control. I have no family support whatsoever, and I feel like I already lean so much on my husband. I am scared to lean more for our marriage will break. I write this because I am scared my kid is beginning to notice. There are days where I can barely get out of bed, unless it is for work. I wish so badly that I had my dad to call. He had his issues, but he got me. I feel like antidepressants only help me so much. Some days I just sit in my car and think, \"I could just smash this into a concrete wall and it would be over.\" I feel like I am a rat in a cage getting nowhere. I have been going through recruiting hell trying to find a new job. I have had many phone interviews, several in person interviews and I am either over qualified, or qualified except one detail they are looking for. I cannot win for losing. Perhaps this is more of a venting post. Am I alone in this? I have always done a great job of putting my own issues on the back burner, pushing through the pain and laughing to keep from crying. But these last 2 months have made me realize that perhaps that was not the best avenue. This is the first time in my life that I cannot escape my depression and my manic episodes. Intrusive thoughts are ever present and beginning to worsen everyday. I cannot brush them off and feel so out of control. I just want to run away. Feeling out of control.',\n",

       " 'do not really know where to start so I am going to recount my life a bit. I am a moderately healthy 16-year-old, who started high school last year. (In my country we start high school as 15-year-olds.) My family is not wealthy but we are not in any serious financial trouble. My parents are still together and I would say they raised me pretty well considering. I have an older brother and an older sister, who both moved out years ago to live their own lives but I am still really close to both of them. I love my family and my pets a lot. Right now I think they are the only reason I am still breathing.I have been anxiety ridden and suicidal for about my entire life. I had really bad separation anxiety as a kid so my mom watched over me at home. I did not go to kindergarten because of it. When school started, I used to spend an hour in the bathroom just vomiting bile every morning because of my anxiety. My stomach ached and I was trembling every morning for years. I was just too scared to go to school, because it was a new enviroment and because my teacher was in my opinion really frightning. I missed entire weeks maybe even months from school. I made plenty of friends but nothing could make me enjoy school since everyday I was just a ball of anxiety that was too afraid to do anything. At the age of seven I held a knife to my throat and threatened to kill myself just so I did not have to go to school anymore. that is how much I hated it.Obviously this was not normal behaviour for a kid so my parents put me in therapy. For years it was absolutely useless. They just made me do these weird excersises which I am starting to think was just some random busy work to keep me entertained. The only thing that helped was that they advised my parents to help me prepare for different things. For example if I had a field trip in a month to a zoo, my parents would take me and my siblings there together so I would have an easier time to go there again. This helped for a while but of course in life you cannot prepare for everything. My anxiety never went away but things became easier for a couple of years.When I was about to advance to seventh grade (13-year-old me) my anxiety was still there but thing were going well. Couple of years pass and my anxiety is going up and down in waves but the school was very understanding and complying, all my best friends were on the same class as me, I had a clear image of the future and my individual therapy was going well. Life was going really well at this point and even though I was anxious I could go to school pretty normally even though I still missed many days. At it is peak my anxiety could because me to have migraines so I had to stay home a lot. Whenever things were going bad I thought about suicide but never planned it out.On my last year before high school my anxiety just sky-rocketed and with it I became very depressed. I was not too outgoing before but now I could not even go to the store without anyone else. I did not want see or talk to any of my friends even though I really liked being with them. Before I was a staight A student but I could not even understand the words on my homework anymore. I was a perfectionist yet I did not care if I finished my assinments anymore. My grades dropped heavily. Smallest decisions became just unbearable to make. On some nights I did not eat because I could not choose what to eat even though the fridge would have been full. Some days I could not get out of bed. So many of my hobbies became untouched. I could not play games like before, I could not play he piano anymore and I could not write stories like I used to. I became entirely paralysed.My therapist was really worried about how I was feeling so they told my parents who had no idea. I was pretending to them that everything was just becoming harder in school and that I was otherwise doing just fine even though I was basically dying inside. My mother called my school and told them that she was pulling me out for 2 weeks to recover. I was basically just too overwhelmed and burned out that I was barely functioning. This was the first time I could really remember me putting a plan together to end my life. I was in so much pain. The only things I cared about doing did not bring me any joy just stress and my pride in my school succes was dwindling because I could not keep up anymore. The only reason I did not kill myself was because I did not want to die in pain and I had no idea how to kill myself without going through absolutely no pain. I have never told anyone about being suicidal anymore. Not to my family, not to my friends and not to my therapist because I am afraid of he consequences.During that time my parents prohibited me from looking at any homework, news or worry about outside life. They wanted me to recover without any possible hindurances and because of that they tried to bring me my favorite foods and give me lots of free time so I could enjoy my time playing games. I have never felt so relieved. Before that I was crying in my bed at night just dreading for the next schoolday The freedom of not having to worry about anything was amazing. At the end of those two weeks I returned to school. I was doing fine for a few days but as the school year was coming to an end I was beginning to feel a lot worse again. All that pressure from school life and my own mind had not disappeared. I had just pushed them away from my mind. I became the bitter and sad hermit who disappeared back into my room like I never left.That same old feeling of freedom returned when summer came and my school year ended. No pressure, no expectations. I did not see my friends during that entire holiday or go anywhere from my home. I was happy and safe in my room even though just outside my window I could see how wonderful the weather was outside. I could finally do the things I liked again and I could actually enjoy them this time.That did not last of course because then I went to high school to continue my studies. To my surprise the first weeks went well even though I was really anxious. Two of my best friends were still in the same school and we had lots of the same classes. I spent every moment with them and I had fun. The problems started when I could not go to any of the tests because of my anxiety. I failed a lot of courses because of it and those set backs started an unstoppable snowball-effect. My self-esteem was in the gutter and I started to hide in my room again. I slowly became me from before that two week vacation. I became more depressed again and more anxious then ever. I could not go to classes. I could not do my homework and I couln\\'t participate in any group activity. I started failing more classes even on subjects that I previously could have aced with my eyes closed. I spent almost three days every week suffering from migraines.For the last 6-7 months I have not been to school at all. I have met doctors and I have met with my guidance counselor for more times then I can count. My anxiety is through the roof and each time I explain my problems to the doctors and my guidance counselor, the answer is always: \"We know it is hard for you to go to school because x,y and z. **You just need to try going to school.\"**Like I had not fucking thought of that before. I am suffering inside my own head, thoughts screaming how I cannot do shit and how behind I am going to be and how useless I am. For every day I started crying because I was so afraid of going to school. I could not read anything because I just could not understand the alphabets. I am nearly having panic attacks when I just think about going school. One day I became so enraged that I punched my door hoping that I would break my own arm. But thanks, I had not thought of going to school. Right now I have been on summer break again but in a week I need to go back to school but I just do not know how I can. I start crying every time I think about school. I just want to disappear and thinking about killing myself has become an everyday occurance. I just cannot handle feeling this hopeless and anxious every day when I have not even started to live independently yet. I am terrified.Any advice/stories from personal experience or just kind words would be very much appriciated.Thanks for reading this far Feeling lost, this is my situation',\n",

Also sorry for bad english in advance it is been a long time since i talked to anyone and in addition i am german.I am 25/m and my first Girlfriend left me in April after 7 1/2 years. She told me \"I am going to find someone better\" and she is right. I live in my mom\\'s basement. I never had a job, i do not want a job and i do not think I will ever be able to have one.I feel like i do not deserve to live but i somehow want to, just not like this. But i could not change anything for the better even if i wanted to. So what is the point? All i can do is think about the things that permanently ruined my body and mind.My very first memory is attending the funeral of my grandpa i was 5 years old back then. At school i have been \"beaten\". They dragged me across the floor untill my back started bleeding. They punched and kicked me every day in the same spot so i got permanent damage. They joked I would be the next schoolshooter and the teacher just laughed. They put a knife in my bag and told the teacher i threatened to kill them if they would not be my friends. I got kicked out of that school because not even the police believed me. At the next two schools at least the teachers were kind.The boyfriend of my mother at the time choked me until i lost consciousness because i pulled my cats tail and my mom just laughed. Eight years ago my father told me he does not care about me anymore because he is got a new family now before that he just used me as a babysitter for my 3 half siblings, so that he can have a relaxing weekend. I guess the oldest one was then old enough to take my babysitter part.Then i met her. Everything that happened to me no longer mattered. I was happy for about a year. Then I developed a hearing disease called hyperacusis. (short explanation: every sound is recognized so loud it causes pain) There is no cure. I had to drop out of school because of that and since then every day, all day i am in my room in the basement. If i try to go for a walk I will end up in panic because i do not want to go out there and on the way back again because i do not want go back into my room.My Girlfriend helped me get therapy. But they came to the conclusion that i am a hypochondriac simply because they never heard of my disease before and did not bother to look it up or tried to put me in group therapy completely disregarding my disease and then blaming me for \"not wanting help\" because i am afraid of people. And since then i... Well i guess i gave up.My cat died two years ago and it just broke me?I started to push the only person that ever loved me away because she tried to help me and i did not even realize it untill it was too late. I have the greatest respect for her to endure me but i also hate her for leaving me like that and all the things she said before breaking off contact. Now i am alone.I have got no one to talk.

I moved back home to my parents basement last summer after going thru severe depression from my first ever relationship ending. i feel really guilty because i said and did horrible things to make my ex feel the pain i was feeling and lost the great friendship we had because i wanted so badly to keep him interested in me- just to make myself feel like i was worth something. or to distract from how meaningless my life has always felt. I am a gay almost 25 year old from a big city and i had a good network of people in high school who still live here but they are all straight and i do not relate to them much. were not close. before moving back home i lived in my college town (another big city). most of my friends there were straight too and i felt different but i had closer relationships with them. since high school I have been deeply depressed and dissociated from my life so much i just showed up got the grades and graduated. no college professors to write letters of rec for grad school. credit score sucks. stuck in a dead end job here that i do a terrible job at because it feels pointless. it requires me to go into areas of the city that have shootings every day so I am always on edge that ill get shot or carjacked. it also sucks being the only gay person in a straight male dominated space. I have switched jobs every six months or so since finishing college 3 years ago so my resume looks too bad to get a cool new job. but i also feel like working in this strange capitalistic society is a waste of my time here on earth. i feel that there is so much i could accomplish but i have no avenues to achieving them. i now have an expensive ass car note so cannot quit my job. i am afraid ill never be successful, have my own place, live a life I am happy with, fulfill any purpose. i fight suicidal thoughts daily. i feel so alone and hopeless and idk where to go from here.

       " 'It would just be nice to share perspective or see how other people help support their loved ones when things get tough or said loved ones are having bad episodes. But I also understand that hearing about said perspective and experience with living with depressed persons might come off as triggering to anyone who is depressed, if I were depressed I would hate to see how my depression has affected others around me. it is an inevitable thing that happens, and it is a complicated issue. But something that I think is not talked about much in my experience.it is a hard pill to swallow but being a part of a depressed persons support group can be really traumatizing when things get bad, more so if you live with them. Like I have had to talk them down from suicide, bring them out of their intrusive suicidal ideation induced by substance abuse, cleaned up their blood after self harming occured, having to see them in a psych ward, being afraid of triggering an episode, being afraid of walking in on a dead body in your own home. And that is not accounting for being there for another relative who was in the hospital after an attempt or having a best friend who is also medically depressed. It is all around me.TW VENT AHEADAnd no matter what, despite all of that. you are always supposed to push down whatever feelings of anger and frustration or sadness you might have in favor of taking care/supporting the person that needs the most help at the moment. And feelings of resentment happen but I personally do not want to feel that way, I feel that letting those negative emotions take over helps no one, much less the person you want to help. But it is so hard sometimes, and it is hard to talk about without sounding emotionally selfish to some capacity, because you have a whole medically depressed person right there! so you automatically feel guilty for even taking your feelings in consideration. Like \"how dare you be negatively affected my someone else\\'s depression, fuck you! their well being and mental health is important than yours at the moment! Suck it up!\" and I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but it is the reality of things. Like whatever I am feeling needs to take a back seat because I need to reserve my emotional energy for when another depressive episode from one of my relatives rolls around. And yes this person has a psyche, a therapist, and meds. If they did not have those things they would have definitely been gone by now, but it still seems like it is going to be a while until they are able to manage their depression. it is just really hard and I feel so alone in these types of feelings I am having, these feelings that i feel like I cannot afford to have. But that is not realistic and these feelings are there and they are eating away at me, it makes me want to run away from it all. But again it can always be written off by a statement like this \"well whatever you are feeling I can guarantee you the depressed person is having a worse time than you right now\" and...they would be right!....and I go back to feeling like shit and the cycle continues. But I feel so written off constantly because I am in such constant and close proximity to depression, i feel like I am not allowed to be cared about or acknowledge whatever it is I am going through or feeling. I just do not know if anyone feels this way. VENT OVERThat said, I think a therapist would be the best answer to my plight but I do not have access to one, no healthcare, I am the process of having that be sorted out. And I know you can only do so much as a support, you are not supposed to shoulder to much of a depressed persons burden, but it is different when you live with them, you see the depression and you experience their episodes from the outside, except you are not exactly a bystander either and you got to get your hands dirty. So that is why i wanted to know if there is any collective of people who has experienced any situation similar. I do not know where else to ask this, but is there a support group for relatives living with depressed persons? or a support group for the support group of a depressed individual? it is a unique experience and I would like to speak with others who have experience living with medically depressed persons.',\n",

But staying in the house all the time makes me feel like I have been missing out on really important life events.I have noticed over the past year it is been getting harder and harder to wake up in the mornings and throughout the day it just feels like a slog. I have become very distant from the work I am doing and do not take it as seriously anymore. It does not really feel like work at this point, just something I happen to do during the day. Everyday's the same and when something goes wrong I feel quite intimidated because I feel like it is invading my private space.I have tried writing and wanted to exploit home working to give me an opportunity to really practice my skills but it is been a disaster and I have not written a single story since the pandemic began. it is my aspiration to be a writer and I feel like I have just flushed it down the toilet. My mood has completely turned me off writing altogether and it just feels pointless at this stage. It sucks too because I get pretty excited about it.In February and March I was having major suicidal thoughts and although they have went away the odd feeling pops back into my head which makes me worry that one of these days I am going to do something to myself. I have tried to make use of mental health resources but I do not really feel like I want to help myself, I check out a website or have a chat with someone and then I drop it again until I have another depressive nosedive. I also contacted a therapist last year but I was not comfortable with phone or video chat therapy due to privacy issues.I badly want to have meaning in life but right now it feels like I live for other people and I am really not enjoying work right now. it is not even the work itself, it is just the thought of doing it. Recently we have been pretty quiet but sitting around doing nothing all day does not help either. there is talk of going back to the office which I think might help if I get back into a routine again but most of my colleagues do not want to go back so I am worried I will be alone, plus it is dependent on if we really need to go into the office (which we really do not as we have shown we can work from home) and Covid cases. there is also certain aspects about office working that I think I will struggle to get used to again, so I feel pretty divided. Covid has completely destroyed my social skills.Sorry if this is a massive rant, I am not exactly sure what to write but I just feel pretty down right now. it is late and I cannot sleep which is when my mind goes on a tangent and attacks itself. I just want to feel like I have some sort of meaning in life and something to hold onto and develop. I was hoping that thing would be my writing but I do not feel like touching it right now because of how unmotivated I feel. I feel like the last year has been an absolutely waste of time and I just feel very replaceable and blank at this point. Feel like life is on hold due to working from home\",\n",

People just walking on this treadmill of work, spend money, sleep and repeat. Ever since I left the country in 2016 I have just been feeling like this place does not work for me. I do not want to become a slave to the matrix and live a boring life of paying bills and working some boring job and having to pay rent or a mortgage for the rest of my life. it is just stupid to me. But what I really realized is how depressing the US is to me. Seeing elderly people living on the streets, seeing the government slowly turn the country into what Orwell warned, and seeing people just sitting idly by and letting it all happen. I feel like it is a lost because to even speak yo about it. I saw a Jim Morrison quote about this and it fully resonated. I find myself not connecting to 99% of people here. Everyone is just so self obsessed and dull. I do appreciate how many different interesting people are on Reddit though. At the same time I believe people are more authentic on the internet than they are IRL. Regardless, I see alot of people doing alot of cool things, and feel a better connection with people here than in the physical world. I just want to make music and build my brand in peace, not having to worry about bills or paying rent and it is sheerly frustrating to try and do it here.

I have ended up here because I feel like I am imploding and just want someone to hear me and know what I feel. I am a wife and a mother of one. My marriage is happy and my son is amazing, but I cannot get away from my depression and anxiety. I have had a bounty of traumatic experiences growing up, but who has not? I truly try to live for each day and leave the past where it belongs. I am extremely self-aware. I understand my mental illness. I am a very analytical person. I think that because of this, it makes my mental health worse. I want to fix myself, but I do not know how. I have extreme fears of being alone. I am terrified my husband will eventually decide to leave me because I am such a disaster (though he has shown no intention of this at all). Who wants to be married to a crazy person, right? I have never been in a relationship that was not emotionally abusive until I married my husband. Both of my parents were drug addicts and I was raised by my grandparents (who are incredible by the way). My biological mother (who was physically and emotionally abusive) is still a piece of work (putting it nicely). It took years, but my dad recovered and I do love him very much even though he still has some issues I am still uncomfortable with. In spite of that I have become a successful person. I swore Id never ever let my children see a moment of what I did as a child, and I have not, but I am still here feeling like a failure. I feel worthless. My insecurity is disgusting and my fears are eating me alive. I guess it does not help that I have barely any friends and now that I am working from home I am basically left to my own torment, every day. I used to have loads of friends when I lived in another city, but once I became pregnant I decided I needed to be closer to family. I did not move back home, just near. So I moved to a small town where I know no one. After starting my job once I moved. I have begun to have friends again, but none of them I feel close enough to be able to really open up. Honestly they are probably very open to listening, but I am still here terrified of judgment and causing what little friends I do have to go running for the hills. Because who wants to be friends with someone so mentally unstable?I am tired of crying and I want my brain to stop. I just want to fix my mental state. I can fix everything else. I can give the best advice and I have picked so many people up from very low points in their lives, but I cannot fix me. I am so sorry this is so long.

       " 'I just want to type this all out because I truly do not know what else to do right now while I sit here contemplating everything. Basically TLDR; my wife has now given me an ultimatum of being in a poly dynamic or we split up. I love her so much, and she had alone given me so much more meaning in life when I met her and made me such a better person. I do not want to be without her no matter what that means but I want her to be happy too. Earlier this year she had been talking to an online friend about the idea of being with him and wanting to and started talking to me on the side bringing up what if we opened our relationship up and went through a lot of emotional and devastating talks about this and I was horribly depressed for months and even suicidal. Eventually she stopped talking to him at all for other reasons and I went to a psychiatrist because I have always had pretty severe depression but did not want to take medicine for it and had finally broken down and wanted to try it as a last resort type thing, like what if it really did all come down to a chemical imbalance. This surprisingly worked with no downside whatsoever and we talked more and more about the possibilities of being poly and I did a lot more researching and talking to people I knew who were in that lifestyle and agreed to give it a shot and thought that I actually did want it and it would be ok. I had been dating a girl for a little while and we have done sexual stuff and she was kind of dating this guy and they had not done anything serious. I noticed that when I did stuff with the new girl it just did not feel great for no reason whatsoever and I kept brushing it off as me being anxious over this new lifestyle. Yesterday my wife had finally told me that her and the guy she was dating did sexual stuff and at that moment, the one that I had thought about so many times to try to prepare myself for and thought I was for sure ok with, I absolutely broke down and told her that I cannot do this. None of my experiences with others have been good and I still cannot truly fathom how people can live this way. I just want her to love me and everything go back to the way it was before. Today while at work she sent me a wall of text essentially saying that I was the problem and that she is going to continue being poly but in the same breath saying how she loves me more than anything which makes zero sense. But it came down to we either stay poly or we split up so I do not see how she could love me more than anything but still prefer to divorce. Anyways I told her that I guess we are going to divorce then because she basically made the decision already but I truly cannot live on without what I had before. I truly felt like I was in heaven being with her all these years and was ready to tackle anything the future had but now thinking about being without her I am just ready for the end. I would love to do something that was more peaceful and painless like the exit bag method but it is now too time consuming and I want to be done soon. And if you read all this way through then understand that I know this has been all my fault for agreeing and getting involved with it and breaking down after hearing her. I am not blaming anyone else but myself for this, I promise, I just want out and she can live her life happily. Also, also, I know I have posted things in here before and obviously I got through them, majority having to do with the earlier in the year issues that went away and I got on medication, but this is different. Things are actually ending in my life and I cannot deal with it. Anyways, I think this truly is goodbye. I think I am finally going to do it (long story)',\n",

Most of my friends I have kept joined the military long term so I only communicate every once in a while through text or call.

We saw eachother almost every day, and talked EVERY single day, without getting into too much detail we were MUCH closer than your average best friend. I have been working on myself for a little over a year, and Id say my mental state for the most part is much better than its been the past few years, and she has been much help with my journey. But at times, I would start arguments with her over minuscule things, that at the time I feel are big. Last week started many little fights that added up. I had the first panic attack I have had in years, and stupid me started drinking (I am not an alcoholic, I just needed something to clear my head) She asked for space, but I kept texting her, I told her I was going to commit suicide because of her ignoring me, and that I was going to go to her house. (I was not going to actually go anywhere as I was inebriated, and I was not intending on physically harming her if that is what it sounds like, I just looked for any outlet of attention). At this point there was no return. I quickly realized the damage I had done, no one should have to deal with the emotional trauma I gave her. Its been almost a week and she wants nothing to do with me. I am not typically a dependent person, but in my entire life I have never met someone so relatable, and I screwed it all up. I have made a few attempts to mend things, but she wants no part. I know the answer is give her space and expect that its over and move on, but I feel terrible.

Well I am out of Sixth Form now, waiting to see if I have gotten into uni, generally doing OK with the help of meds, then suddenly one tiny bad thing and BOOM. I want to take some scissors to myself. I acted like a shitty friend, said I was ill when I just was not up for voice-chatting, and now I just want to punish myself again. And to be honest? I do not see why I should not. I did something wrong, they are too nice to call me out on it, so I should carry out punishment myself. With the area I have chosen, there is little to no chance of any risk, and I do not really mind scars, so why the hell not? I deserve it!

Anyway, here is my deal: I have always had low self-esteem and a pessimistic worldview. In the last few years, I;ve been working on getting better; I managed to land my dream job, have some good friends, a supportive family etc.Then the pandemic hit and I had to move in with my parents who live in a small town, far from my friends and I am now about to lose that dream job I had, since it was a. freelance writing gig with an expiration date. My contract is only valid till October, then I am SOL and have NO IDEA what I am going to next. Anyway, this is just to give a little context about where my life's at rn, but the thing is that I have been able to deal with everything so far, but for the last idk how many days, I have not. I have been having trouble sleeping and I have to absolutely force myself to do anything (sometimes I am able to, sometimes I am not), most of the time I lay in bed and watch stuff until around 2am, then I go to sleep and start all over again. I have also been crying a lot out of nowhere and have this sense of dread and hopelessness all the time. I do not want to do anything, I do not feel like talking to anyone and I just wish I could just not exist anymore. IDK I guess I am just wondering if that is just regular sadness about my life being in a bad place right now or if I might benefit from getting professional help and asking for support. Thanks! I need help understanding if what I have been struggling with is actually depression\",\n",

       " 'I am so proud of myself. I finally got my butt back into therapy after struggling for the past three years and was diagnosed with severe depression (no surprise I just think I did not want to hear it). I am finally being consistent with getting help since this therapist is a great match for me. they are smart, quick witted, and good at calling me out on my bs and getting me to reflect on my own thought patterns. While I still do not feel better I feel more hopeful and I am grateful. I have started to enjoy life again. I have taken it upon myself to finally start making healthy changes in my life to recreate a headspace that invites more positive thoughts. Some things I have done the past few months to force myself out of the comfort of my sadness: - I have started journaling again. Every morning I try and write down one thing I am grateful for in my life. My therapist also recommended I journal every time my mood plummets so I can get it off my mind and on to paper. - I quit vaping. Vaping was a terrible crutch I used to aid my anxiety, it was not an easy quite but its been a couple months now and it feels good to be free. - I started reading again. I replaced my phone time at night with books so I can get away from social media. I am extra proud of this because its been years since I have read for pleasure and I forgot how much I loved it. I just finished my first book since starting again and I hope this is something that I can keep up. - I started learning how to reach out to friends and family when I am having a bad day. Swallowing my pride was hard. I believed I always had to be 100% happy all the time so no one would ever worry about me or think less of me. I am grateful for the support system I have. To everyone who is still struggling I hope you are able to get the support you need. Depression is nasty but I hope you find someone or something to help you bear the weight.

I thought I hated my body, I thought that I was sad because the boy I liked did not like me, I thought I was sad because my parents never understood me. But those were all the things I would tell other people when they asked if I was okay, although I never really cared about any of that. The truth is I do not really feel anything. I try to pretend I care about things to seem normal to other people and I pretended for so long that I ended up believing my own lies. I was so out of touch with my feelings I had no idea I was actually depressed, I thought I was living life the way it is supposed to be lived but it never felt right. I have never taken my future seriously, in fact I have never taken anything in my life seriously. I got arrested for shoplifting, and while my friend cried I started laughing, because I really could not care. I do not care about my studies, I only have good grades because I am asked to. I do not even feel happy or proud when I get a good grade. I do not have any real life project or expectations for my future. I have been living all this time letting other people decide for me because I do not really want anything. Nothing motivates me. When I was a child I liked to draw, to read, to write. None of those things motivate me anymore. I thought I was happy because I partied, I drank, O smoked weed and hung out with my friends. I thought I was happy because those things made me feel alive. When I am alone I just pretend I am living a different life, but I never thought that was fucked up because I thought it was normal. I want to know if people that are not depressed experience life differently. Do they seriously care about things? Everytime something bad happens to me, it is almost like it happens to someone else. I feel emotions as if I was deep inside of the ocean and there were muffled sound coming form the outer world. it is almost like I drown my own emotions. If someone insults me, if someone hurts me, if someone rejects me I never really cry about it or feel sad or anything at all. it is like I have become numb.Nothing makes sense. Nothing here makes sense. it is like I do not know how to be alive. I thought it was completely normal to go to sleep late, to eat too much or too little, to feel tired all the time, to never be able to concentrate. But now some stupid online test tell me that those are symptoms of depression. I thought everybody was just pretending like I did. This is such a different type of depression. I have experienced hate for myself, I have experienced anxiety and hate for my body. I thought THAT was depression, and the nothingness and the pretending were all just part of my personality, just the way I was born. I do not know how to be different, I do not know my feelings or myself. I do not really know or want or feel anything. it is the strangest feeling, and I know it is been there all the time but I never recognized until now.

Its unreal how much those in power have completely ruined the natural interactions that humans used to have. Almost every single way that people interact these days is twisted and unnatural. Humans were never meant to live this way, but for some reason we continue to, day after day, much to our own dismay.

People were not always this way, but they act like there is no other alternative or other ways to live. All of these things going on within society and the interactions between us have caused my heart to become harder over the years.

Been so damn scared of social stuff that I have just played singleplayer games and watched a few youtube channels over and over and over because discovering stuff is also so damn... scary somehow. Everything just falls down and confuses me. Fucking everything. I get the impressions and how you should think to crash with each other. To name a few, you should not be mainstream while being against mainstream is considered bad. do not be casual and to be hardcore can sometimes be cringey. I am just so confused so when I pick on youtube channels, music artists and such I pick from groups of people I follow that I think are not mainstream/casual and not edgy but in the middle and go from who they know. And how people find these in the middle or edgy people are so confusing to me. Same with everything \"internet\"/meme. Always wondered that. I feel so outside, so lacking in everything. And in these 10 years I have made so much progress outside with my social anxiety but I keep failing and making it the other way when it comes to online. Multiplayer games are pretty much impossible. It feels as if I was not meant for this world',\n",

On meds I just lay in bed and maybe watch a movie at best to pass the time waiting for the depressive period to pass but on the meds it never actually does pass. it is obvious I have some form of imbalance but the meds have such a profound effect on me and change me on such a fundamental level. They change some things for the better and others for the worse but ultimately it is just different, not better. I have tried sertaline, fluoxetine, venlafaxine.

I am gay, autistic, virgin, pursuing a useless degree (we will return to this), no driving lisence, barely any money under on my name, and below minimum wage income. My future is looking bleak and tbh worse than that of everyone around me. Though they can only help so much. I have yet to find the passion, drive (or whatever that makes you go from point a to point b) in my life.Who can tell well it all went wrong? My tiger mom? Maybe. My emotionally distant dad? Who knows. Sheltering and undersocialisation? Maybe. I have been dealing with depression and suicidial ideations since age 10. My parents made me go to a foreign language school (they wanted me to mingle with other \"elite\" kids) which so to speak was the most traumatic experience of my life (crying and begging my parents not to make me go there, can you guess wheter they listened?) I was bullied daily for 10 years of my life.Everyday of school was a struggle, to say I got used to this is an understatement. Even in my head I cannot find my own place in life, regular panic attacks and feelings of dread come in every month or so, demoralising and demotivating.Recently got an internship in a business consulant company where I constanly underpeform due to lack of knowledge in economics, drive and the problems listed above. I got the position on the promise that I will start a Finance BSc next semester. If being late in life in other aspects already was not enough, I am graduating with a BSc at 26 which makes me feel terrible. The feelings of dread and inadequacy just cumulate and I am getting close to being overwhelmed. Wierdly enough in times like this I want to talk and meet my mom. I want to get back into the womb where its warm and safe unlike outside here, sheltering, sheltering. I have wonderful friends and family members who love and support be but being so much behind in life compared to them and not being able to keep their advices in my head makes me feel terrible. Since my experience with most things is utter failure it does not make for a good though pattern does it? Afraid of life and in general of everything, but wierdly enough people see me as \"normal-acting\" (sic!) I guess at least I was always good at masking.This is one of my dreadful periods, each is worse than the previous. Feeling more lost than ever, positive thoughts occuring less and less.

She had became distant months ago and became more so as time passed. I am curious to know if this could be normal behavior of someone who is feeling overwhelmed and is moving through depression. All I wanted was to be there for her and to feel that she still cared. Once it felt like she did not care anymore, I could not do it any longer.

I have received psychodynamic psychotherapy for about 3.5 years but it helped up to a point as its main goal is to make the client realize and be conscious of mental patterns and act on them. I am looking for new ways to heal myself. Basically, even if there is nothing going on, I feel constant anguish, distress, anxiety, and existential pain. I see no meaning of life at all but this is not due to my psychology but my philosophical approach to life. I am an existentialist in a way. Plus, to me, there is no meaning of suffering in life as other toxic positive people claim that suffering makes us strong bla bla. Why would I suffer? I want to have fun in life which also leads to laziness for me sometimes. However, my feelings are generally negative. How can I overcome my anguish, anxiety, and distress? Is there helpful approach of psychotherapy for me? I am also in an alert state all the time that other people might harm/hurt me (due to survival instincts; for instance, in business or for money).

I used to be a very bright student who scored all A grades during my secondary education but ever since I started my high school, my grades have been drastically dropping because I am depressed all the time. I come from a big family with a history of bright minds and all my cousins, siblings and peers are all extremely well performing, meanwhile I am being a disgrace to my family. The pressure on me is immeasurable. I basically have no other talents, I have a weak, skinny body and I am not at all good at any sports either. In my attempts to search for something I am good at and as an attempt to hide my sexuality, I started going for basket-ball practice with some boys (because I found the game compelling), but only felt a burden to them and the only one who did not show any improvement in months, so I quit it. I do not even know what my career would be and what to try for even if I considered to live an unmarried life (which is again risky because I will be constantly judged). My social life is also non existent because I have just 2-3 friends who I talk to, and not one of them is close enough for me to share any of these with. I tend to distant everyone because I fear they will know my truth. I am also very insecure about my looks and my body so I have ceased to go out whatsoever unless necessary. I was also bullied back then at my hometown for having a feminine attitude until I got extremely sick and my family had to move to the city for better treatment for me, and ever since I have refused to return to my hometown even for a vacation. That said, I am also a sick person with a weak immune system and my family pays too much for my health care, for my studies etc and I do not think any of it is worth it. I also recently did a huge mistake, which is dating a girl who confessed to me, as an opportunity to change/hide my sexuality or in case someone is suspecting I was gay, only to hurt her due to lack of affection from me. I could not bear hurting her anymore so I broke up with her, but could not give a good reason for it, and it turns out she still loves me to this day and is constantly getting hurt. My siblings, parents have no idea what I am going through and often mocks me and jokingly comments on how I am good for nothing, not like other boys, ugly, etc. So I often avoid interacting with them either and isolate myself in the room for most of the time of the day.

I want to just take a shitload of tylenol and hope that I am not the 60% of people who experience pain during liver failure.I promised my girlfriend that I would get her help. Shit, I got a panic attack brcause I could not get her an online meeting with a psychiatrist that could help her as soon as possible. I promised her she would be happy again soon. I promised her I would stay. I promised her that she would get better. But she is not. She is not getting better.I am the one making things worse, she cannot see it, but I am. The most recent argument left me devastated for no fucking reason whatsoever, apart from me realizing that its not something else that is the problem. Its not that we both have problems. Its meI am the problem.I want her to be happy and find someone better than me. Someone that will not use manipulative tactics without realising. Someone who will be able to trust her again easily even after breaking my trust once. But I broke hers \"for the better\" and that ended in a dumpster fire. All I leave behind is chaos. The bad kind of chaos. I need to pull out the weed from the flower patch by the root, so it will not grow again. I dom\\'t want her to come with me. I want her to find someone better than me after I am gone (if I find the courage to take more than two pills of tylenol) and live those dreams we had with a proper man that will take care of her and can take care of her. I am sorry Margarita. I am sorry that I have done all of this to you. I love you. If anyone can help, please do but I want her to let go so she will have less suffering, pain and toil than what she is currently experiencing with me.

As soon as there is even a smidge of pressure and am alone I lose control over my emotions and stress out over everything.I guess I should write a bit about myself. I am 22, have asperger syndrome, live with my parents and attend university (forestry major). In primary school and highschool everyone called me smart. All my live I kind of strolled through it with no resistance. I was happy. I never had trouble with anything. But once I entered university that gradually changed. Suddenly things became hard, people had expectations of me. I have to know what is to come months in advance and prepare for it.I feel fake. I do not have the passion for foresty my other classmates had. I only chose this major because I kind of liked biology class in highschool. But I never had a passion for it. In highschool I could just stroll along and do fine, but that just does not work anymore. Everyone wants me to know what I want. I do not know what I want! Or its more like I do know what I want I just want an easy life. An easy job. I wish I joined a college instead or maybe some kind of trade school, maybe I could have learned carpentry or plumbing or how to fell trees. Id be happy just working under a boss, 9 to 5, just do as I am told. I could have had my own home by now if I did that. Id be able to come home after work and do something else. Play some games, watch TV, maybe get into a new hobby like reading or writing, maybe try dating. I cannot do any of that in college. I am constantly anxious and overwhelmed and I cannot pay attention and I do not know what to do and I fear that all jobs in this field will be equally stressful and exhausting.Despite the trouble I described I largely made it through all my classes. I actually only have 1 test that I need to resit. But I do not want to do it anymore. I wish they never put the idea in my head that I am smart. I do not feel smart. I feel like an idiot that cannot handle the real world. I am so exhausted from looking for internships. I am so tired from having to do a large project each semester along with having to learn for multiple huge tests.I cannot quit university now. That would kill my mother, she is so worried about it. I can feel it in everything she does. So that is what I want to do. I want to at least finish university, and then I will see what I do.I wish I could do my entire life over again knowing what I know now. Id do it all so differently. Id spend more time being active, going outside, moving, learning new things, learning how to deal with adversity, Id find something I am passionate for or at least something I could enjoy doing as a peaceful job.I hope this rant is not against the rules or anything. I read them and it seems fine. Writing down my emotions and regrets like this makes it easier for me to process my emotions.

Like legit we were behind on bills for a month or two. We only just recover from that and as we are talking about getting kitchen appliances, our puppy desexed, maybe have a date night, we get fucking curb stomped and we are left without transport and will be dealing with this shit for the next month. We probably will not have any money for the next month and a half. Like living off noodles idk if we will be able to pay our rent no money.it is just one fucking thing after the other and it is been this way for years. I am so fucking beyond depressed and miserable. What the fuck is the point of life if it is just a constant struggle. Is this fucking normal? Is this what life is like for everyone? I am so fucking sick of it. When does shit get to level out and be okay? It feels like I am never going to get better and I am going to be miserable for the rest of my pathetic life.

       " \"Apologies in advanced because this is going to be a long one, tl;dr at the bottom for anyone who wants to skip over it. I am just having a bad night and found this reddit, so figured a good as place as any to get it all out there and maybe seek some kind of advice.&amp;#x200B;My mental health struggles started when I was a kid, I was diagnosed with ADHD and prescribed Ritalin as well as told I should probably seek some type of counseling along with the treatments. However, after a few short weeks my parents took me off the meds because they did not like how it made me act (From what I hear, a common complaint.) Unfortunately no treatment or anything was ever followed up with so I have been dealing with that untreated for awhile: Honestly I am so used to it at this point that the symptoms I deal with (I have always described is as not being able to make my head silent.) are so ingrained as normal that I forgot about it for a long time.&amp;#x200B;Aside from that, I was actually a happy if not otherwise busy minded kid. However, things changed when I was ten. Without getting into the nitty gritty details two major life events happened: The first was an extremely bad car crash that left my mother with a painful and permanent physical disability that not only made living physically painful but also completely changed her personality due to the mix of pain and eventual medications. It also left me with deep mental scars which I have been told is a form of PTSD. I still cannot drive to this day because being in vehicles gives me panic attacks, even just riding does and as I am sure you can imagine a panic attack behind a driving wheel is potentially disasters as well as how...crippling it is to not be able to drive in today's world, especially when you do not live in or near a city with public options. The second thing was molestation and rape, something that went on under my parent's nose for five years. It only stopped when the person in question essentially moved away. My mother only found out a few years ago when I broke down about it - the rest of my family is still in the dark about it. This is where a lot of my problems really stem from and my life took a nose dive from this point onward. Depression, suicide attempts when I was younger, self loathing, hating the world and just all around being confused and angry at everything and everyone with no way to deal with it.&amp;#x200B;To add on to it and forgive me if this offends anyone but being a male, I felt like I could not even seek help for it for the longest time. The stigma is not as strong now ah days, though it does still exist, that many of the things that happened to me cannot really happen to guys and if it did there are..well, I am sure you get the picture. Despite this I have seen doctors, I have been given..so many diagnosis it is hard to keep any of them straight, been on a lot of pills which never seemed to work and currently am unmedicated and seeing no one.&amp;#x200B;This brings me all the current day. Despite all these issues I met someone who loves me. We got married recently. I have been happier then I had been in years, in all honesty she is the only person I have left anymore. My family wants nothing to do with me and vice versa. But now that I have someone who depends on me as much as I do them...my mental state is getting worse. &amp;#x200B;I still cannot drive. it is preventing me from getting work. My self loathing has turned into almost paranoid delusions because I cannot rectify in my mind why she would even stick with me or love me. The more she tells me it is alright, the more she tells me I do not have the worry about it, the worse it gets. The majority of her family hates me because they think I am a lazy sack of shit. I try to talk to her about it but I end up just making her feel bad, like she is doing something wrong when that is not the case. I feel like I am spiraling out of control, I feel like she would be better off without me. I just do not know what to do or how to deal with any of this. My mind is so twisted with what I think is happening and what is actually happening, I almost cannot separate the two and tell which is real and which is just my fucking head talking. I thought for awhile I was getting better but now I feel more afraid and alone then I ever have before and I am doing it entirely to myself and I do not know how to stop it.My life has felt like a constant train wreck up until this one bright point, this one little miracle happened to me and I am going to absolute shit over it. I need help. I need advice I need something. I am terrified to lose her. I am terrified of hurting her some way or another or dragging her down with me. I just do not want to be alone anymore yet I feel like I am driving myself towards that inevitable conclusion.So if anyone has any advice..anything at all please...help me. Sorry for the long post..just needed to get it out.tl;dr PTSD, life long depression, ADHD, all relatively untreated. Managed to fall in love and get married. Was happier. Now it is all crashing back down and just...royally fucking with me. cannot drive, cannot get a job, feel completely alone and worthless. Afraid to hurt the one person I love. cannot imagine what she sees in me. Not sure what to do with my life anymore\",\n",

This happened to some degree almost every single time. did not matter what the form of intimacy was (talking, cuddling, kissing, or having sex), but the more sexual the situation the worse the anxiety nausea was.I have only ever had one partner and we were together for about 4 months but i had to break up with her because the anxiety got so severe that my feelings were lost for her because i was overwhelmed with how intense the nausea and anxiety was. it got to the point where even just hanging out with her (and have nothing go on between us) made me sick to my stomach, and sometimes she could not even touch me or i could not even look at her. she was not abusive or manipulative by any means, in fact she was the most supportive person i could have asked for. when things were getting steamy she would ask if i was okay and if i needed a minute (when the nausea happened i would step out of the room/car and walk around taking deep breaths) and she completely understood. she showered me with acceptance and understanding and i still could not get over the nausea and anxiety. We were completely open and transparent with eachother and it still happened. The level of nausea varied each time, though. sometimes it was a little, other times it was so intense i could not move. only a few times did i not have nausea at all.

I get so anxious sometimes that its hard to hide, and I am so terrified of opening up about it to many of the people I care about because I am afraid of letting myself be vulnerable like that. I know its probably irrational, but I am afraid that if they know the full story, they will come to see me the way that I see myself as a result of it all. Yet on the contrary, whenever I get anxious and start having flashbacks and stuff, I want nothing more than to have someone to break down to and to be completely vulnerable with without having to worry about how it would change their perception of me. I wish I could just let it all out like a little kid, but that vulnerability terrifies me. It results in a vicious cycle that I am aware is completely self inflicted, I am like the author of my own misery. If I was actually all that strong, Id be able to talk about it in detail without tensing up and getting sweaty and anxious. If I was actually strong, Id be able to not worry about being vulnerable like that. The fact that I do not have that strength is part of what makes me loathe myself so much.

       " 'As the title says, the week of July 12th was one of the worst in my life. I feel completely defeated at this point and I just want to give up. I have been seeing a psychiatrist and therapist for the last 7 years, and, for awhile, it was helpful for me. We found a good cocktail of medicine that helped me feel normal, and helped me function with my day-to-day activities. But, around the end of May I noticed that my meds just were not as effective as they once were. I have to state that I have been suffering from depression, anxiety, and PTSD since 2003. I have also been suffering from insomnia in varying degrees of severity since then as well. I cannot stress how absolutely miserable it is to want nothing more than to sleep and not be able to.So back to the 7/12. I had been visiting my family for awhile since I have been working from home for a year and half, and I did not want to be alone every single day. Plus, I missed our family dog dearly. So it was great to spend time with her. While I was home, I also got a dog for myself, just, the sweetest little thing. But low and behold, she was born with a genetic condition that requires she get a total hip replacement. that is going to be 8K after all is said and done. I do not have that kind of money. Not at all. Anyway, when I left to come back home to take care of things here, I left my dog behind because her surgery was scheduled back where my folks live and I did not want to stress her out with a lot of back and forth travel. When I left, I did not get an opportunity to say bye to our 15 year old family dog. I figured I was coming back for my dogs surgery in August, so Id see her then. And then I found out my family had to put her down on 7/12. That little dog meanteverything to me. I have been used and abused and discarded by people all my life. My family (not my nuclear family, but the rest), my friends, everyone. But that little critter loved me unconditionally. And now she is gone. And I did not get to say bye to her. Furthermore, my dog is slated for surgery on 8/12, one month to the day of the other dogs passing. And, while I am not superstitious, its still causing massive anxietyjust in case anything happens to her. When I got back home I found a new psychiatrist; Id changed insurance earlier this year. However, he does not accept insurance and its $500 a session. I researched psychiatrists in my area and hes highly recommended and rated. And I like him. However, the costyeahalso not helpful for my stress and anxiety. We also changed my anti-depressantwhich now costs me 400 bucks a month. Again, cannot afford any of this. My weekly therapy is $130. I earn a good amount of money but I happen to live in one of the most expensive areas in the US, so my income does not go too far. So I have just been panicking. I am in a ton of debt. I have been trying to do everything right to help better myself. But every time I start to make progress it gets derailed. I have gained about 90 pounds in the last year. And I cannot seem to lose it or change my dietary habits because its so hard for me to care when I feel so exhausted. My job sucks, I am paid 60% of what I should be earning in my field as an entry-level position (though I have been doing this for 7 years). I have started looking for other jobs but its just exacerbating my anxiety. Like, to the point where its crippling. I feel like I am barely holding it all together and that, at any moment, the dams going to burst and Ill just spiral. I do not know what to do anymore. Id love for all of this to just be over. I am just so tired. I have had some of the worst weeks of my life and I am just so tired, deflated, and defeated.',\n",

Summers always tend to be worse for me since I start to feel alienated and extremely lonely since I am not in college classes and I am stuck with just my parents and my brother. I struggle making friends, and the only people I talk to on a regular basis are all online and live on the opposite end of the continent. I have only really had one irl friend, who keeps ghosting me. I am very motivated by being able to experience things with others, so this has resulted in a lot of me not doing anything at all.I love my family, but they have zero filter and often do not understand that because of my depression and mild anxiety, I sometimes do not take jokes very well, especially ones targeting things I am already struggling with. And like all family members, they love to poke and prod until I snap at them or, in rare cases, until I start crying. A lot of times, their comments will hit me right in the anxiety and I have that moment of \"I have to change everything about myself so I am perfect. Perfect people do not get made fun of.\" and it is driven me to actively avoid things I love, as well as mental heath topics, when they are around. it is always a chore trying to navigate that in the summers. Everything has just been so much worse lately for some reason. there is just this ugly feeling in my chest and that horrible need to just make people hate me so I can justify feeling this way. This is easily the worst I have been mental health-wise in like a year, and I am starting to struggle a little and letting the bad thoughts linger.

I know I will work tomorrow, but when I am done... maybe exercise (that is not a big deal to me, it is more of a habit now anyways), but otherwise I just cannot function.I was supposed to be productive because weed was making me guilty for not improving my life, which needs it... but now I am not doing anything and I am completely sober. That depression is hitting hard again and I am trying to not numb it. I cannot say weed is a factor here, but I am thinking it is definitely one of them. Now I am feeling guilty again, but without the substance to block it out. I will not go back to drinking casually by myself (thank you green for helping, I admit that), but... shit man. Quitting green should not be this hard. I have cold turkey addy abuse before, and even then I was getting brain shocks from that, but those have ceased long ago thankfully. Scary shit.I cannot get out of my head that my 34 year old life can be fixed. I compare myself to everyone and just talk myself down about it to a terrible fault, but I just want to be happy and achieve my goals.

I cannot continue this life in this state. In this state of having customers yell at me over the phone, constantly beating myself up, and knowing that tomorrow, I will not be able to improve.

Opening up to her just causes her pain because I know she just wants me to be happy with her. The thing is though, I would not be anywhere as happy as I am now without her. she is my world. I just do not know what to do. I feel guilty for her having to be around me like this. I feel like I have to wear a mask all the time',\n",
       " 'I am a 17(f) Lately I have been feeling more and more depressed, I look back at my old self and how I used to be when I was younger. I used to be filled with life and always hang out with friends I had a good relationship with my family I would say that that was probably the best part of my life so far sadly:/I cannot even look at myself in the mirror I always avoid mirrors because I hate myself.Coming from a mexican household my mother does not believe in mental health problems. She always says \"you have food, clothes, and a roof over your head! Why are you sad? You should be grateful for all the things you have.\"My parents are divorced, I have 3 siblings but the oldest left to live on their own. My oldest brother had a huge argument with my mom and they have not spoken/seen each other for four years. I also have a 2nd oldest brother who has Autism, he is also mute and he pretty much needs help with everything. he is pretty calm and does not look like he has special needs, but he makes noises which annoys me and I feel bad for being embarrassed/annoyed with him. Right now I am living in an apartment with my mother and Autistic brother. My mom has to work 24/7 so that means that I have to look after my brother which feels like a full time job. I can never go out without bringing him along because I cannot leave him alone I am already embarrassed by him so I cannot even go out. I feel like even if I wanted to move out I could not because I have no money and I have no opportunity to go and make money for myself. My father is also pretty absent in my life:/I also have no friends because my best friend of 8 years and my friend group decides to exclude me out. I was bullied by them my sophomore year.I feel like I am stuck, everyday is the same. I do not see a reason that I should keep waking up everyday. I am not pretty or skinny so that does not help either. I just want to pause my life and breathe and to go be able to do the things I want to do but I cannot. I imagine that I will be my brother\\'s guardian once my mom passes away. she is healthy now but I do not want to be responsible for him but I do at the same time because I feel bad.

       " 'Hi, I am new to Reddit and this is my first vent post, so this might be a little long and all over the place. I just wanted to rant about some things I have been feeling lately. Any nice comments would be appreciated. I am a sophomore in college and a student athlete, my sport being swimming. My first year was the worst I have ever performed and I am scared that Ill never amount to anything. I feel like I am steadily declining and losing the only thing I have been successful at my whole life. I used to be really great at what I do and really respected, and now I am fucking pathetic. All of my efforts each day do not do shit and I have not improved or made any progress at all. If I cannot do well at something I literally dedicate my entire life to, all that tells me is that Ill never be good at anything and Ill just be mediocre my whole life. Nothing special. A worthless, pathetic loser. I just want to die, but I know Id never actually have the guts to kill myself. It feels like suicidal thoughts are always in my head though. I have tried hurting myself recently but I was too afraid to go any further. I am so obsessed with my weight and I cannot look in the mirror without wanting to rip myself apart. I fucking hate myself. So much shit is going on in my head that I cannot even begin to try and deal with it, so I spend most of my time laying in bed consuming 5 different forms of media at the same time so I do not have any time to think. there is so much going on and so much I feel is wrong with me but I do not really know what it is. I am diagnosed with anxiety and depression but I feel like the shit I deal with is more than that. But my whole life my parents would always tell me that I overreact about everything and that I just needed to toughen up and be a big girl. I cannot even trust myself and my own feelings anymore. I do not understand anything and I am so tired of my mind being like this. I do not know what to do or how to help myself anymore. I just want to give up. I feel stuck in this deep hole and have no hope of getting myself out of it.',\n",
       " 'So I have been feeling this way for, well ages. After a few life changing moments a few years ago I suddenly actually want to stay. A few things kind of magically fell into place for me which made life not seem so bad. do not get me wrong. I absolutely still have those heavy dark days that feel like it will never pass. I am fighting my best fight but I have recently noticed I am slipping back into old habits. For example, I have that nagging feeling that I am just not good enough unless I work myself to the bone, even picking up a second job in the process, and if I do not then I am worthless and not worthy of love. I have resorted to needing sleep aids to have a regular sleep schedule just to be able to keep myself functioning to work 12 hour days 6 days a week. A lot to unpack there but I am kind of ignoring it for now. Today was an ok day, but a coworker who came in for shift change complained loudly and angrily to another coworker near me about how poorly closing was the night before. Small things like securing lids on produce and closing bread bags were missed. I closed last night and of course it was a bad night for me where everything is a blur and my memory is shot so then I began to list off in my head what I did and what I must have forgotten. I became even more upset upon hearing them complain about seeing me and other closers off the clock relaxing at the bar (I work at a tavern) and how no one should have clocked out without a proper walk through. It just so happened to be my birthday which my coworkers found out about and I stayed for a single drink out of feeling obligated to celebrate and I NEVER stay after for a drink because I feel so uncomfortable in social situations. I was close to tears as I hurried to finish up and clock out this afternoon. Am I taking his outburst as validation for how awful I already feel about myself or was my reaction appropriate? Me forgetting something at closing when I am normally very diligent about completing tasks correctly is horrifying for me and now I never want to clock out early again even though my manager let me leave early last night. I just need a little help navigating this situation and how to handle it when my boss confronts me about it next time I clock in, which they definitely will because the complaining coworker has lead to confrontations with my boss in the past. I want to never have to clock in again. I am terrified. Need help navigating uncertainty',\n",

       " 'It makes me laugh, in a half-shocked-half-depressed kind of way, that the common discourse around depression is still that it is an individual problem.For when the way that we live is so drastically different from how we evolved, it is not hard to see why our minds may create some friction. We live disconnected from anything meaningful: work, relationships, nature, but above all, meaning itself. Anyone who refuses to accept that the meaning of life is to work for money and possessions is sick in the head, disturbed, mentally ill.Your body uses pain to tell you that your current situation is dangerously off. Then, is depression not your mind telling you that something needs to change? And if so, how sick is it to try to change the mind itself, to try to convince it that no, pain is actually fine, there is nothing wrong. Our minds are trying to tell us that we are not meant to live this way, that there IS something greater to experience in life than sleepwalking through every dull day, collecting our checks so that we can pretend to have fun for a few hours each weekend. Our minds are trying to get us outside, into nature, to find friends and do real, meaningful activities with them, to get away from all the stress, anger, and jealousy of the cities and return to how we were meant to live. A simple life, with meaningful work, meaningful goals, meaningful friendships, but above all, a way to find meaning in every action, to feel like there is a reason to live.There is something better. We do not have to live like this. We are not meant to live like this',\n",

No matter what i try, i either end up hurting myself more in the progress or failing miserably from the beginning.I applied for roughly 30 jobs in the last two months and almost got rejected from everyone because i had a burnout in my senior year due to my teacher and my sister moving out. And the ones where I actually managed to get an interview quickly shut me down because i got self harm scars from when i was younger.And ofc the only way i know how to get rid of this shit is either SH or drowning out my sorrows in videogames and just pretending it did never happen.But that is not the part that makes me not be alive anymore, i got an emotionally abusive mother and an physical abbusive father, the occasional kick or punch i can deal with, but it my mother who really hurts me. Every single time something is missing in the house, Dosent matter what it is. I get accused of taking it, eating it, or having it last and thus loosing it. Followed up by a verbal assault of what a disappointment i am, how useless i am and how she sometimes wishes she would have aborted me.I often considered running away atleast to a friend or atleast the unemployment office to get away from here. But the last time i brought up living with a friend for a month she ran into my parents room threatening to kill herself if i moved away.In the last couple of weeks it has been extra rough for me idk why, but i just cannot seem to let go of the past. Like rn i just lay in bed trying to fall asleep but just cannot and keep doing stuff to drown out the memories of my best friend simply using me to get closer to crush to date her and then botch ditching me.Another friend of mine just using me for money because she knew i needed someone and that i would buy her things just to not leave me alone again.Seeing my best friend since middle school slowly getting addicted to drugs until he killed himself.My first gf cheating on me and even afterwards telling me how good it felt.And tbh the thing that hurts the most is Hannah, she was a friend of my GF and me at the time, and when shit hit the fan she was there for me, i cried so fucking much during that time and she was there for me, i tried to be the best friend i could at that time cheering her up even though I was fucked myself. But apparently i did not do good enough of a job\"It would be better for all of us if you finally killed yourself\" That still sticks with me today, i think about it every single time i get closer to someone, every time i talk to a friend. That maybe they all think so and she was right, that i should stop beeing such a pussy and finally kill myself.Its funny that i kept this to almost last tbh, maybe its because i do not really want to talk about it, or because it happened at such a young age that is its practicaly a part of me at this point, when i was i think 8 or 9 I was sexually assaulted by an older classmate i think 11 or 12 I am sorry for the numbers.At first it Started out as playing, then someday he just undressed and acted like nothing was wrong, and suggested we play doctors and such idk what is he called it I am sorry. Idk it just kind of happened and then stopped someday when he switched schools. I cannot have a bodily relationship with anyone, if someone hugs me without asking and telling me beforehand i get panic attacks, when i layed in bed once with a friend of mine i had to get up because i just could not stay next to bed in ber and feel scared.I just do not want to live with all this fucking baggage anymore, every single day seems to get worse and worse.

This has led my down a darker path, I have stopped studying, running (I was a marathonist), gained 20kg from anxiety eating, and I barely brush my teeth. I have gone back to self-harming pretty much every day after being clean for 4 months and have planned to take my own life on August 1st, even wrote my goodbyes to my family and my girlfriend. I want to get help, I know I am not okay and just found out my insurance covers psychiatric interventions (yayyy) but I am a bit scared to go there since I, during psych rotations in nursing school, I dealt with some pretty scary situations. I would love some insight about what it is like in there and here your thought about itThanks in advance, have a wonderful day Has anyone here ever been to a psych ward? If so, what is it like?',\n",
       " 'I do not know what to do, what to focus on, what to believe in, what to spend my time on. The noise inside my head is deafening and I feel uncertain about everything. I question everything. I have no faith, no love, and no sense of conviction about the future. I just wish I knew what to do. I am so lost',\n",
       " 'I am in Sydney and things are bad. I live by myself and I am extremely lucky in that I am allowed to go visit my boyfriend on weekends which helps a lot. However its been going for like a month and it seems to get worse every day here with no end in sight. Life just feels so terrible, I cannot even go sit on a bench outside without being moved along by police. have not seen my friends in who knows how long and work has been terribly stressful. Anyone got any hot tips?? Fuck How to avoid offing yourself during a severe lockdown?',\n",
       " 'Hello fellow redditors!First of all stay strong and keep fighting I have been taking antidepressants (escitaloprame) during my episode of major depression for about 4 months. Now that I am doing better I am going off the meds. By now I do not take any of those. While the antidepressants originally gave me sleeping issues I am starting to notice something that others probably would not consider a problem: I often wake up after 4-5 hours of sleep, not even being tired. I have never had so little sleep without further impact, the lowest amount I have had before when I was relaxed has been around 6 hours.I know that there is a little chance to have specific genes that allow low amount of sleep. However I wondered if my observations might be due to antidepressants changing the brain activity in the long run.Have any of you had similiar experience with sleeping quality after going off antidepressants?PS: I suspect that I have had dysthymia through my whole life with some depression episodes inbetween so maybe my sleep quality increased because I am finally fine - something that I wish for every single one of you! Sleep changes after taking antidepressants',\n",
       " '#NAME?',\n",
       " 'I just feel so utterly empty and alone. Do you guys ever feel like this? It feels like there is a black hole inside of me, slowly eating away at me and taking my soul.I am 22 and I cannot make friends or get a girlfriend. The loneliness just gets more crushing every day It feels like there is an actual hole in my chest',\n",
       " 'Honestly, not even sure what I want to say. Kind of just want to let people know about motherhood and clinical depression. Not post-partum depression. I have struggled with self-hate ever since I was kid. I believe that nobody could, can, or ever will love me, including myself. There just really is not much to like. Not soon after it became depression and I have just lived my life like this. I am married and have 2 kids. Just want to quickly say that depression is different from being depressed. Being depressed (as my doctor explained) is usually from outward influences. Depression is pretty much a neurological disorder that can be caused through trauma and the like. But yeah, it does not get better with time like everybody says, I have been waiting for a while for that miraculous day to come. Really, I have no idea what I want to say. I guess if you struggle with depression, please get help before getting into a serious relationship or having children. You may think that those things will help you (I did) but they do not. Instead you are family becomes almost an excuse for you to push yourself over the limit. Anyway, I recently reached out and told my doctor and have been put in touch with a psychiatrist. It was hard to tell somebody as the only person who sort of knows is my husband. And I am legit scared to see a psychiatrist and talk about it again, but I am waging a war with myself. Get help or disappear before my 2 year old is able to remember anything about me. Personally the latter seems like the better option but then I think about what it would do to him in the future. Would he really think I loved him and did it for him, or would he think that it was his fault and that he was the problem? So I am getting help instead. There is so much more I want to say about having depression and being a mother, but it will literally be a book and nobody wants to read that, so yeah. It sucks, but get help. Where to start',\n",
       " 'So its been already a month and a half since I started feeling really bad, like the meds does not kick in anymore. So as my psychotherapist in vacations I want to know what are my options before I discuss them with him Anti depressors are not effectives anymore and I am already at a very high dosage what is the options I have ?',\n",
       " 'I do not even know where to start I have had/ have a screwed up life, anything bad that can happen does. I have been depressed since I had my daughter and it gets worse and worse. My family has nothing to do with me basically but a select few and the people I do have our not supportive to me with my mental health. I know I am screwed up but I have no insurance or money to pay to get help from a professional when I get down or alone I just need family there to help but most time they just get mad at me and say this again or ruining another time or even I cannot do this anymore. My daughter who is just a child is the only support system I have and I cannot talk to her about anything. I do not know what to do my family says I ruin there lifes because way I am but I do not know how to fix me. I try to hide how I am feeling from family but then it builds up and I explode and its worse but if I show it then its bad to I really do not know what to do or where to go. I do not have any friends I have people I call friends but but they people I talk to once every few months. How can I do this when I do not have anyone in my corner no one that is patient enough to deal with me. I get some my family have mental stuff to but on their bad days I am right there with them supporting helping them through no matter what. I need help figuring out how to get help without insurance or money in away that does not involve my family. Alone and depressed',\n",
       " 'This year, things seemed to be doing good, finally got on t and mood started to stabilize to the point where I was not having meltdowns in broom closets at work dailyNow into the summer it comes backYear before this was in inpatient because I was hearing shit that was not there and decided to hospitalize myself because it was making me suicidal Year before that was out on leave for 4 months, again around the same time of year late summer/late November, that time because my doctor upped the dosage of a medication that fucked up my mood dissorder severelyYear before that was because I was suicidal, was pre t, hospital staff threatened to tackle me if I did not remove my chest flattening garment and kept me in a hallway full of strangers and misgendered me the entire time, had a meltdown in front of said strangers who began to openly mocked me. I cannot afford to keep hospitalizing myself and if I try to just go back to my job I am going to end up killing myself, there is nearly a 100 foot drop from the balcony to the floor in the building I am working in, I have thought about it, I have never gone too far but have had attempts through other means. it is going to be complaining and saying \"hey something is wrong and I need actual financial support and therapy from someone trained to handle trauma in a way that is not just telling me I have anxiety and that what is going on is normal I need help or I am going to die\" and no one will take me seriously until it actually happens. The only reason I am not dead now is because the thought of people going \"wow we had no idea this would happen\" makes me physically ill. cannot fucking do this shit anymore always back to square one',\n",
